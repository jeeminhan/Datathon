[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything or anyone

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

[Verse 2]
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
[Verse 3]
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

[Bridge]
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
[Outro]
