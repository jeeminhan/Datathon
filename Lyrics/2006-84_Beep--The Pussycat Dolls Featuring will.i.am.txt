[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
Every boy's the same since up in the seventh grade
They've been tryna get with me
Tryna ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
They always got a plan to be my one and only man
Wanna hold me with their hands
Wanna ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
I keep turning them down
But they always come around
Asking me to go around, that's not the way it's going down
[Pre-Chorus 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
'Cause they only want, only want
My ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Only want, what they want
But, na-ah-ah, na-ah-ah

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]
Do you know that no
Don't mean yes, it means no?
So just hold up, wait a minute, let me put my two cents in it
One; just be patient
Don't be rushin' like you're anxious
And two; you're just too aggressive
Tryna get your ahhh

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nicole Scherzinger & Carmit Bachar]
Do you know... that I know?
And I don't... wanna go there...
Yeah they only want, only want
My ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Only want, what they want
But, na-ah-ah, na-ah-ah
[Chorus: will.i.am & Carmit Bachar]

[Post-Chorus Repeated: will.i.am]
Boom-boom, boom-boom

[Bridge: Nicole Scherzinger]
Ooh, you've got it bad, I can tell
You want it bad, but oh well
Dude, what you got for me
Is something, I
Something I don't need
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
