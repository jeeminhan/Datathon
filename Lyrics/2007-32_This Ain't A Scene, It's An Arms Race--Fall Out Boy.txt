[Verse 1]
I am an arms dealer fitting you with
Weapons in the form of words
And don't really care which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing, that's just the business I'm in

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress

[Chorus]
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I'm a leading man and the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate

[Verse 2]
I wrote the gospel on giving up
(You're looking pretty sinking)
But the real bombshells have already sunk
(Prima donnas of the gutter)
At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars, no, more like p-p-p-parties
[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
Bandwagon's full, please catch another

[Chorus]
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I'm a leading man and the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoo!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
All the boys who
The dance floor didn't love
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough
Sing until your lungs give out

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Now you!)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Wear out the groove!)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Sing out loud!)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Oh, oh!)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race!
[Chorus]
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I'm a leading man and the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
