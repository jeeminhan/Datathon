[Intro]
Hmm...

[Verse 1]
Hey, baby girl, I've been watching you all day
(All day, all day, all day)
Man, that thing you got behind you is amazing
(Amazing, amazing, amazing)
You make me wanna take you out and let it rain
(Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
I know you got a man, but this is what you should say

[Chorus]
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more o' them gray skies
Girl, we flyin' on a G5, G5
And we're leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Man, she got me singin')
She got me singin' like (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Now if I talk it, girl, you know that I will walk it out
(walk it out walk it out walk it out)
Man, I'll put my money, money where my mouth is
(Mouth is, mouth is, mouth is)
'Cause you the baddest little thing that I've ever seen
Ever seen ever seen ever seen
So I'ma ask you one time, if you got a man

[Chorus]
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more o' them gray skies
Girl, we flyin' on a G5, G5
And we're leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that
(Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Man, she got singin'
She got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, she got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
She got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Girl, you got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Bridge]
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Just tell him to the left, left, left
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
'Cause we gone and we gone and we gone
No stress, no stress, no stress
Girl, you deserve nothing but the best
No stress, no stress, no stress
Girl, you need to tell him

[Chorus]
That I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more o' them gray skies
Girl, we flyin' on a G5, G5
And we're leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singin' all night, like that, like that
