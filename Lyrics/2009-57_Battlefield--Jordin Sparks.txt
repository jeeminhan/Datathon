[Verse 1]
Don't try to explain your mind, I know what's happening here
One minute it's love and suddenly it's like a battlefield
One word turns into war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down?
My world's nothing when you're gone
I'm out here without a shield
Can't go back now

[Pre-Chorus]
Both hands tied behind my back for nothing, oh no
These times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now?

[Chorus]
I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? (Oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh)
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? (Oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh)
Why does love always feel like...
[Verse 2]
Can't swallow our pride, neither of us wanna raise that flag, mmm
If we can't surrender, then we both gonna lose what we had, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
Both hands tied behind my back for nothing (Nothing)
Oh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again
I don't wanna fall for it now

[Chorus]
I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? (Oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh)
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? (Oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh)

[Post-Chorus]
I guess you better go and get your armor (Get your armor)
Get your armor (Get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your armor (Get your armor)
Get your armor (Get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your...
[Bridge]
We could pretend that we are friends tonight (Oh-oh)
And in the morning, we'd wake up and we'd be alright
'Cause baby, we don't have to fight
And I don't want this love to feel like...

[Chorus]
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
A battlefield (Oh)
Guess you better go and get your armor

[Chorus]
I never meant to start a war (Start a war)
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
(Fighting, what are we fighting for?)
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? (Oh-oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh-oh)
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? (Oh-oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh-oh)
A battlefield (Oh-oh-oh)
[Post-Chorus]
I guess you better go and get your armor (Get your armor) (Yeah)
Get your armor (Get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your armor (Get your armor)
Get your armor (Get your armor)

[Chorus]
Why does love always feel like...
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Why does love always feel like...
(Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) A battlefield
A battlefield (Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Outro]
I never meant to start a war
(Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Don't even know what we're fighting for
(Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I never meant to start a war
(Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Don't even know what we're fighting for
(Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Hey...
(Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
