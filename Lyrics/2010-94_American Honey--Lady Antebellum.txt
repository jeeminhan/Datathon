[Verse 1]
She grew up on the side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good, she grew up slow
Like American honey

[Verse 2]
Steady as a preacher, free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin', but wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey

[Chorus]
There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey

[Verse 3]
Get caught in the race of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey, yeah

[Chorus]
There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey
[Bridge]
Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, there's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey

[Outro]
And American honey
Mmm, mmm
