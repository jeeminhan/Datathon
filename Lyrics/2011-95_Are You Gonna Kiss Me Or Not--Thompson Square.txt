[Verse 1: Keifer]
We were sitting up there on your momma's roof
Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

[Verse 2: Keifer]
Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

[Chorus: Keifer & Shawna]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?

[Verse 3: Keifer]
It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

[Verse 4: Keifer]
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me
[Chorus: Keifer & Shawna]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

[Verse 5]
[Keifer & Shawna]
So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
[Keifer]
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

[Verse 6]
[Keifer & Shawna]
When the preacher man said, "Say I do"
I did and you did too
[Keifer]
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

[Chorus: Keifer & Shawna]
Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
[Tag]
[Keifer]
Yeah baby I love you a lot
[Keifer & Shawna]
I really think we've got a shot
[Keifer]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
