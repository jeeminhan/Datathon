Sleepin' in my bed (Hey! Ho! Ho!)

[Verse 2]
So show me family (Hey!)
All the blood that I will bleed (Ho!)
I don't know where I belong (Hey!)
I don't know where I went wrong (Ho!)
But I can write a song (Hey!)

You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet..

I'd be standin' on Canal (Ho!)
And Bowery (Hey! Ho!)
And she'd be standin' next to me (Hey!)

I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart

Love, we need it now

You're my sweetâ€¦
