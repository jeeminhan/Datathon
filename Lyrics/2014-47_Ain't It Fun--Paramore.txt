[Verse 1]
I don't mind
Lettin' you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, well just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feedin' on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ah-ah-ah)
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?

[Chorus]
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone

[Verse 2]
Where you're from
You might be the one who's runnin' things
Well you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
You see it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble
[Pre-Chorus 2]
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you? (Mm-mm-mm-ah-ah-ah)
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you? (Oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah)

[Chorus]
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone
(Oh-oh-oh) Ain't it good to be on your own
(Oh-oh-oh) Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
(Ah-ah-ah) Ain't it good to be on your own
(Ah-ah-ah) Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world

[Bridge: Hayley Williams & Choir]
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Ain't it fun, ain't it fun
Baby, now you're one of us
Ain't it fun, ain't it fun, ain't it fun

[Chorus]
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good (Ain't it go-oo-ood)
Bein' all alone
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
('Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good (Ain't it goo-oo-ood)
Bein' all alone
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Outro: Hayley Williams & Choir]
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Not to your motha)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (Don't go crying)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (To your mama)
'Cause you're on your own (Hey) in the real world (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Yeh, yeah)
'Cause you're on your own (This is the real world) in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Don't go cryin')
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (This is the real world, this is the real world)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Don't go cry-y-y-y-yin')
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Don't you cry to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' (Don't you go, don't you go cryin')
Don't go cryin' (You're on your own)
Don't go cryin' (Don't go cryin' to your mama)
Don't go cryin' (Don't you cry, don't you cry)
