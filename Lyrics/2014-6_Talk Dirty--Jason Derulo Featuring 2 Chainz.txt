I got lipstick stamps on my passport, you make it hard to leave

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Been around the world, don't speak the language (Uh-huh)
But your booty don't need explaining (Uh-huh)
All I really need to understand is (Uh-huh)
When you talk dirty to me

Talk dirty to me (What?)

Every picture I take, I pose a threat (Yeah, oh)
Bought a jet, what do you expect?

Anyway, every day, I'm tryna get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty" (Haha)
Anyway, every day, I'm tryna get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"
[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
