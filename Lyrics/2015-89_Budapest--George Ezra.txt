[Verse 1]
My house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo

[Refrain]
You, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all

[Verse 2]
My acres of a land
I have achieved
It may be hard for you to
Stop and believe

[Refrain]
But for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all

[Chorus]
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
[Verse 3]
My many artifacts
The list goes on
If you just say the words, I'll
I'll up and run

[Refrain]
Oh, to you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, ooh
I'd leave it all

[Chorus]
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

[Post-Chorus]
A-ooh
A-ooh
[Verse 4]
My friends and family
They don't understand
They fear they'll lose so much
If you take my hand

[Refrain]
But for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd lose it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd lose it all

[Chorus]
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

[Verse 5]
My house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo
[Refrain]
You, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
