[Intro]
Nah, nah, nah
Cake by the ocean

[Verse 1]
Oh, no
See you walkin' 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious girl, why those feet cold?
We just gettin' started, don't you tiptoe, tiptoe

[Pre-Chorus]
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (Huh)
You should be rollin' with me, you should be rollin' with me (Ah-ah-ah)
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy (Huh)
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously

[Chorus]
Talk to me, baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
[Verse 2]
Goddamn
See you lickin' frostin' from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm beggin', "Yes, ma'am"
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (Huh)
You should be rollin' with me, you should be rollin' with me (Ah-ah-ah)
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy (Huh)
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously

[Chorus]
Talk to me, baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy (Ah)
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (Huh)
Walk for me, baby (Walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Ooh, ah, ah
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
Ooh, ah, ah
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
[Refrain]
You're fucking delicious, haha
Talk to me, girl

[Chorus]
Talk to me, baby (Talk to me, baby)
I'm goin' blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (Hey)
Walk for me, baby (Walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go (And go what?), fucking crazy (That's right)
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' (I keep on hopin'), we'll eat cake by the ocean, hot damn

[Outro]
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready, I need it every night
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
