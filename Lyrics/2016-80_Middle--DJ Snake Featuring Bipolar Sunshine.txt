[Verse 1]
Starin' at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee has gone cold, it's like time froze

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There you go wishin', floatin' down our wishin' well
It's like I'm always causin' problems, causin' hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
Are we gonna sweep this under the carpet?

[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world
For us two with you in the middle

[Break]
(You in the middle)
(You in the middle)

[Verse 2]
(Ly-, ly-, ly-, ly-)
Lyin' down beside you, what's goin' through your head?
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Am I just overthinkin' feelings I can sell?
This gut feelin' I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missin' pieces and just chill
Are we gonna sweep it under the carpet?
[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world
For us two with you in the middle

[Break]
(You in the middle)
(You in the middle)

[Outro]
(You)
Thank the children, just thank the children
(You)
Thank the children, just thank the children
