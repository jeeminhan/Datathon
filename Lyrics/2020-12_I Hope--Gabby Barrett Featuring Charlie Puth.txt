[Gabby Barrett:]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile
On the other end of a phone
In the middle of the highway driving alone

Oh, baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along
And gets you thinking about her
Then the last several miles turns into a blur
Yeah

I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy

I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need

And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

[Charlie Puth:]
Yeah, babe, I hope he shows up in a 2 A.M. pic from a friend
Hanging on to a girl to just rub it in
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then he calls

And, baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about
Forget and let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know he's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy

I hope he comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope he spend his last dime to put a rock on your hand
I hope he's wilder than your wildest dreams
He's everything you're ever gonna need

And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me

[Gabby Barrett:]
I hope what goes, comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her that I feel about you right now

I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy

I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need

And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

[Gabby Barrett & Charlie Puth:]
Like you did on me
