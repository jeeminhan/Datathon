Metro, Metro, Metro
Yeah (Ayy)
(Slap, slap) Metro, Metro (Slap, slap, slap, slap, turn it)

Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodging death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feeling sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been running through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models getting faded in the compound
Tryna love me but they never get a pulse down

(Why?) 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man but I'm heartless
Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be falling out the pocket
Metro Boomin, turn this hoe into a mosh pit
Tesla pill got me flying like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watching
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffel bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone and Bazaar now
Selling dreams to these girls with their guard down (what?)
Seven years I've been swimming with the sharks now

(Why?) 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man but I'm heartless
Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

I lost my heart and my mind (My mind)
I tried to always do right (Do right)
I thought I lost you this time (Time)
You just came back in my life (My life)
You never gave up on me (Why don't you)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you)
I don't do well when alone (Oh, yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man but I'm heartless
Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
