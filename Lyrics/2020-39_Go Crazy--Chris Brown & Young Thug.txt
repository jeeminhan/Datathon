Stamp check got you livin' life, but you ain't workin' though
Her man said that way long, I'm the first to know
She ain't in control, she want a birth, can get a Birkin though
Go crazy through the trap and show me love now
Can't allow one hundred niggas wavin' her on Clubhouse
Off the '42 with my dawg, I feel like Dugg now
I done sipped so much pints of red, I think I'm Blood now
I'm from the trenches for sure, for sure
You got my back? Let me know, me know
In Post Oaks homie close, we close
Rolls truck, hit the button just to close the door, yeah

Trips to your crib in the middle of the night
I know that you miss me 'cause I put it down right
Damn, babe, I can put you on a flight
You know that a nigga like me can change your life

They think you shy, but you a freak, that's why I spoil you
I could've hit it for the free, Christian Dior you
I'm sweeping you off of your feet in the space shuttle
I come through, go swimmin' in the middle of the night
We trending worldwide 'cause, baby, we on fire
Had a threesome with a Muslim and a Christian
I swapped our religions, felt like Jesus Christ when I did it (Oh, ayy, bring it, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back)
Have you ever went skinny dippin' on a flight?
PJ came with a bag full of ice, oh, baby
I could change every life
Solitary's whiter than rice, going crazy
I could have whispered to this bitch on this remix (Oh)
She just came out of [?], I can see it
Like the pussy the enemy, every time gotta kill it
Chandelier baguettes, look like we fuckin' in the mirror
Break your back, Kelly got you flyer than a kite
Richest nigga she fucked, made her a virgin twice
Don't block none of these goofies, just curve these guys
Reminisce 'bout you had when you see what I got
You amazing when it come down to showing you mine
You my favorite girl, they all wanna know why
I done changed wardrobes, I done changed your style
I'ma change your life, girl, tell me it's about time

Trips to your crib in the middle of the night (Trips to your crib)
I know that you miss me 'cause I put it down right (Down right, baby)
Damn, babe, I can put you on a flight (Oh)
You know that a nigga like me can change your life
