[Verse 1: John Martin]
There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Chorus: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

[Verse 2: John Martin]
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend
[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Chorus: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

[Bridge: John Martin]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
See heaven's got a plan for you
See heaven's got a plan for you
See heaven's got a plan for you

[Chorus: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
[Outro: John Martin]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Yeah!
