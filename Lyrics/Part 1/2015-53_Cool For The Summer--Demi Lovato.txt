[Verse 1]
Tell me what you want
What you like
It's okay
I'm a little curious too
Tell me if it's wrong, if it's right
I don't care
I can keep a secret, can you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer

[Break]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I, we're cool for the summer
[Verse 2]
Tell me if I won
If I did, what's my prize?
I just wanna play with you, too
Even if they judge, fuck it, I'll do the time
I just wanna have some fun with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer

[Break]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try (Try)
'Cause you and I (You and I), we're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer
[Interlude]
Shh...
Don't tell your mother

[Breakdown]
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite

[Chorus]
(Take me down) Take me down into your paradise
(Don't be scared) Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try (Wanna try)
'Cause you and I (You and I), we're cool for the summer

[Outro]
(Take me down) We're cool for the summer
(Don't be scared), 'cause I'm your body type
(Just something) Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I (You and I), we're cool for the summer
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We're cool for the summer
