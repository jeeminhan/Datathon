BL$$D
What's in that bag, boy?
Rollie, rollie, rollie (Rollie shit)

[Pre-Chorus: Teo]
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Teo]
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie (Yeah)
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie (Yeah)
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me (Yeah)
Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me (She on me)

[Verse 1: Teo]
My Rollie don't tick-tock, it just glide
Keep starin' at it and you might go blind
I be movin' clean, I don't even try
All I see is bands, bands, I spy
Yeah, that way, I need that moola by Tuesday
Yeah, that way, I low key feel like feng shui
I just now got started, got views on views, I'm poppin'
My diamonds goin' retarded, your girl on deck, it's a party
[Pre-Chorus: Teo]
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch (Rollie, Rollie, dab, dab)
I already got some designer to hold up my pants

Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch (Rollie, Rollie, dab, dab)
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me

[Verse 2: Ayo]
Blue face Rollie, red face Rollie, ayy (Woo, woo, yeah!)
Purple face Rollie like some Teletubbies, ayy
Baby diamonds wet, shinin' like some guppies (They wet, yeah)
Your man's hatin', probably 'cause his girl love me, ayy
I pull up to the mall and I'm flexin' on your ho (Ha)
Jahleele in the cut, and he got them buffies, ayy (Got them buffies)
Whiteskins got me goin' crazy, crazy, ayy (Ayy)
Your girl love me 'cause she probably want my baby, ayy (Woo, woo!)
Ice on my neck cost like five K (Five K)

Pull off up in a 'Rari or a Bentley, ayy (Skrrt)
