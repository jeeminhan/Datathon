[Verse 1]
I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down

[Chorus]
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart

[Verse 2]
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

[Chorus]
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's grippin' down on a cold one

[Chorus]
'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart
