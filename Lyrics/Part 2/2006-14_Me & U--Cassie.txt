BadBoy

[Verse 1]
You've been waiting so long
I'm here to answer your call
I know that I shouldn't
Have had you waiting at all
I've been so busy
But I've been thinking 'bout
What I wanna do with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know them other guys, they've been talking 'bout
The way I do what I do
They heard I was good
They wanna see if it's true
They know you're the one
I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too
Now, it's me and you

[Chorus]
It's me and you now
Uh, I've been waiting (Waiting)
Think I wanna make that move now
Baby, tell me if you like it (Tell me if you like it)
It's me and you now
Uh, I've been waiting
Think I wanna make that move now (Gonna make that move now)
Baby, tell me how you like it
[Verse 2]
I was waiting for you
To tell me you were ready
I know what to do
If only you would let me
As long as you're cool with it
I'll treat you right
Here is where you wanna be

[Pre-Chorus]
I know them other guys, they've been talking 'bout
The way I do what I do
They heard I was good
They wanna see if it's true
They know you're the one
I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too
And now it's me and you

[Chorus]
It's me and you now (Baby, it's)
Uh, I've been waiting (Me and you)
Think I wanna make that move now (I'm thinking 'bout making that move)
Baby, tell me if you like it (Tell me if you like it)
It's me and you now (Uh-huh)
Uh, I've been waiting (Hey)
Think I wanna make that move now (Gonna make a move)
Baby, tell me how you like it (Yeah)
[Bridge]
Baby, I'll love you all the
Way down, uh
Get you right where you like it
I promise you'll like it (I swear)
Just relax and let me make
That move (It's our secret, babe)
But keep it between
Me and you

[Chorus]
It's me and you now (Oh yeah, yeah)
Uh, I've been waiting
Think I wanna make that move now (Gonna make that move now)
Baby, tell me if you like it (Tell me if you like it)
It's me and you now
Uh, I've been waiting (Yeah, yeah, uh)
Think I wanna make that move now (Gonna make a move now)
Baby, tell me how you like it (Uh-huh)

It's me and you now (Me and you)
Uh, I've been waiting (It's just me and you)
Think I wanna make that move now (Uh, it's just us two)
Baby, tell me if you like it (It's just me and you now)
It's me and you now (I've been waiting)
Uh, I've been waiting (For your love, I've been waiting)
Think I wanna make that move now (Gonna make a move now)
Baby, tell me how you like it (Oh)
