[Verse 1]
Honey why you callin’ me so late?
It’s kinda hard to talk right now
Honey why you cryin’ is every-thing okay
I gotta whisper cause I can’t be too loud

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my girl’s in
The next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

[Chorus]
It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin’ my name it sounds so sweet
Comin’ from the lips of an angel
Hearin’ those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

[Verse 2]
It‘s funny that you’re callin’ me tonight
And yes I’ve dreamt of you too
Does he know you’re talkin’ to me
Will it start a fight?
No I don’t think she has a clue
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my girl’s in
The next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

[Chorus]
It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin’ my name it sounds so sweet
Comin’ from the lips of an angel
Hearin’ those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my girl’s in
The next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

[Chorus/Outro]
It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin’ my name it sounds so sweet
Comin’ from the lips of an angel
Hearin’ those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
(And I never wanna say goodbye)
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
Honey why you callin’ me so late?
