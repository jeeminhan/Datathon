Chorus
I don't get breaks, I just make time
I don't get awards, I get deadlines
Toke another pound, got a head high
Never get caught, never get fined
Livin' on the low, call me Loki
Brother like Thor, Waititi
She never loved me like Kiki
Make sure she don't forget how she did me

Verse 1
Never make a scene, this ain't a movie
You may be living large, but your rep is amusing
Surrounded by the people who you think are your posse
Just to realise that they fake and they flaunting
Bounce out this joint to the next one
Keep it going hard in the moment
If it makes sense, it's an omen
All white drip to the church in the morning
Pray to the Lord we get it right this time
Another chance at life, we don't get rewinds
Take a step back if you want to find
Another outlook to the past behind
Lookin' so good now, only hear the whispers
Did he have something done ov'r the past weekend?
This here's all natural, nothing is fake
You can't relate 'cause the hate's all you make
Chorus
I don't get breaks, I just make time
I don't get awards, I get deadlines
Toke another pound, got a head high
Never get caught, never get fined
Livin' on the low, call me Loki
Brother like Thor, Waititi
She never loved me like Kiki
Make sure she don't forget how she did me

Verse 2
I am on another level
My feet firmly on the ground though
Wake up early every morning
To live the life my dreams are
Out of all this commotion we gon' be better off on our own
Just 'cause this world was built to be owned or to be slaved off
Grab the whips from the guards
How the tables have turned for the opps
Cause the dealer and his cards
Have cheated their way just by being at large
Masks off, Rey Mysterio
Pump it louder, on the stereo
Black eyed peas, find the peace, cause hysteria
At this point, we ain't close and it's critical
Clever with the bars, call me nifty
Racking up the hits, get shwifty
I'm halfway gone to be fifty
But bitches find me smooth with the bread like jiffy
Peanut butter on the toast, and that's the tea
Next time I spit a fire verse, I ask for fees
I own everything I say, apostrophe
A killer on the loose, call me Ted Bundy
Chorus
I don't get breaks, I just make time
I don't get awards, I get deadlines
Toke another pound, got a head high
Never get caught, never get fined
Livin' on the low, call me Loki
Brother like Thor, Waititi
She never loved me like Kiki 
Make sure she don't forget how she did me
