[Verse 1]
I like where we are
When we drive, in your car
I like where we are, here

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
Our lips can touch, here

[Chorus]
Well, you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I've missed you quite terribly"
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

[Verse 2]
I like where you sleep
When you sleep, next to me
I like where you sleep, here

[Pre-Chorus]
Our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
'Cause our lips can touch, here
[Chorus]
Well, you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I've missed you quite terribly"
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

[Bridge]
Our lips can touch
Our lips can touch, here

[Chorus]
Well, you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I've missed you quite terribly"
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

[Chorus]
Well, you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I've missed you quite, I've missed you quite"
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

[Outro]
Here in your arms
But here in your arms
