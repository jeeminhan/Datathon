[Intro: Akon]
Konvict, Konvict
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Colby O'Donis]
I peeped you on the phone
Just showin' off your stones
And notice that that pinky ring is right enough, baby
I know you're not alone
But I could just be wrong
The way them fellas houndin' and sizin' you up, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Colby O'Donis & (Akon)]
And I like the way you take advantage of
Every man you love
(I see) I seem to know your game girl
But I don't mind if you come and play your thug
Just don't talk too much
(I see) I see it, so you don't have to say a word

[Chorus: Colby O'Donis & (Akon)]
Yeah, those guys wanna come treat you right
‘Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' up the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Girl, you know that you need to stop
[Verse 2: Colby O'Donis]
Girl, I can tell you want something to love
That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist, girl, I can't lie
Now tell if you are here for me
Or everybody watchin' you shake from left to right
The way you move got me hypnotized

[Pre-Chorus: Colby O'Donis & (Akon)]
And I like the way you take advantage of
Every man you love
(I see) I seem to know your game girl
But I don't mind if you come and play your thug
Just don't talk too much
(I see) I see it, so you don't have to say a word

[Chorus: Colby O'Donis & (Akon)]
Yeah, those guys wanna come treat you right
‘Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' up the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Girl, you know that you need to stop
[Verse 3: Akon]
Can’t keep my eyes away from you, girl
When you get on the floor and do what you do
And everybody wanna come back to that body
The kind that remind me something like you
‘Cause you’re that type that drive a man crazy
And snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back
He'll end up callin' you, baby
And they never really know what to do
Once you expose that thing you do
You had him crawlin' on hands and knees
And you find a way to get him out that cheese
And why you thinking you're the only dude?
She off in the mall livin' off of you
Lettin' everybody know she got you
But now you feel like a fool

[Chorus: Colby O'Donis & (Akon)]
Yeah, those guys wanna come treat you right
‘Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' up the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Always talking 'bout what you got (Eh)
Girl, you know that you need to stop
