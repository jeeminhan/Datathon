[Verse 1]
The best thing 'bout tonight's that we're not fighting
Could it be that we have been this way before?
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

[Chorus]
But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

[Verse 2]
This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed, but I have loved you from the start

[Chorus 2]
Oh, but hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
It's impossibleâ€¦
[Bridge]
So breathe in so deep
Breathe me in, I'm yours to keep
And hold on to your words 'cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight when you're asleep

[Chorus 3]
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

[Outro]
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find
