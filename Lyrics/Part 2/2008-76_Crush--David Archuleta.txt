[Intro]
Ooh, whoa, whoa
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside, it was a rush, what a rush (What a rush, rush)
'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
Just too much, just too much (Just too much)

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

[Chorus]
Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away
Going away
[Verse 2]
Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time, girl
Are we just friends? Is there more, is there more? (Is there more?)
See, it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe that we can make this into
Something that will last, last forever, forever

[Chorus]
Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away
Going away

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do I keep running from the truth?
(Why do I keep running?)
All I ever think about is you (All I ever think about)
You got me hypnotized (Hypnotized)
So mesmerized (Mesmerized)
And I just got to know
[Chorus]
Do you ever think (Ever think) when you're all alone (All alone)
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love? (Crazy)
Is it real or just another crush? (Another crush, yeah, yeah)
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away (Whoa)
But I know this crush ain't going away (This crush ain't)
Going away (Going away)
Going away

[Outro]
(Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?)
Going away (Going away)
(Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?)
(Oh, going away) Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Going away
