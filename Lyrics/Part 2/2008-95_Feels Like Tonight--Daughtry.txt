[Verse 1]
You, you got me
Thinking it'll be alright
You, you told me
"Come and take a look inside"
You believe me
In every single lie
But I, I failed you this time

[Chorus]
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
Tonight

[Verse 2]
I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right

[Chorus]
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
[Bridge]
I never felt like this before
Just when I leave, I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever-changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

[Chorus]
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight

[Outro]
Tonight (feels like tonight)
Tonight (feels like tonight)
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
Tonight
