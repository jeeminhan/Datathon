[Verse 1]
Hey, slow it down
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
Yeah, I'm afraid
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?

[Pre-Chorus]
There might've been a time when I would give myself away
Oh, once upon a time, I didn't give a damn
But now, here we are
So whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?

[Chorus]
Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
[Verse 2]
Yeah (Yeah), it's plain to see (It's plain to see)
That baby, you're beautiful
And there's nothing wrong with you (Nothing wrong with you)
It's me, I'm a freak
But thanks for loving me (Yeah)
'Cause you're doing it perfectly (Perfectly)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there might've been a time when I would let you slip away
I wouldn't even try, but I think you could save my life

[Chorus]
Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, whataya want from me? (Whataya want from me?)
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me? (Whataya want from me?)

[Bridge]
Just don't give up on me
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
So
[Chorus]
Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up (It messed me up)
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Whataya want from me?
Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, whataya want from me? (Whataya want from me?)
Whataya want from me? (Whataya you want from me?)
Whataya want from me? (Whataya you want from me?)
