[Verse 1]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

[Interlude]
I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop

[Chorus]
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

[Verse 2]
Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
"Perfect" couldn't keep this love alive
[Interlude 2]
You know that I love you so, I
Love you enough to let you go

[Chorus]
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

[Post-Chorus]
I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

[Bridge]
Ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone (Ooh, oh)
Ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

[Verse 3]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
[Chorus]
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

[Outro]
I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone
