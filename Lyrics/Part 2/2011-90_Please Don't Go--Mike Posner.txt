[Verse 1]
Let's run away from these lies
Back to yesterday, safe tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the sun creeping up like tick tock
I'm trying to keep you in my head, but if not
We'll just keep running from tomorrow with our lips locked
Yeah, you got me begging, begging

[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave, I'm gonna find you
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't, baby, please don't

[Verse 2]
Baby, please don't run away
From my bed and start another day
Stay instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the sun creeping up like tick tock
I'm trying to keep you in my head, but if not
We'll just keep running from tomorrow with our lips locked
Yeah, you got me begging, begging
[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave, I'm gonna find you
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't, baby, please don't
Baby, please don't

[Bridge]
I stay running from tomorrow
I stay running from tomorrow
Well, I stay running from tomorrow
Said, "I stay running from tomorrow" Oh

[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go (Please don't go)
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave, (I'm gon', I'm gon', I'm gonna find you) I'm gonna find you
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go (Don't leave me, leave me)
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't, baby, please don't
Baby, please don't run away
