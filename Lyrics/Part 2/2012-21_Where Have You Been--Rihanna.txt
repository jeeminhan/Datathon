I've been everywhere, man, looking for someone
Someone who can please me, love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man, looking for you, babe
Looking for you, babe, searching for you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd, oh

[Chorus]
Where have you been?
All my life, all my life
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my li—

[Verse 2]
I've been everywhere, man, looking for someone
Someone who can please me, love me all night long

Looking for you babe, searching for you baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd, oh

Where have you been?
All my life, all my life
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my life?

Any way, any day
Just show me where you are tonight
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
