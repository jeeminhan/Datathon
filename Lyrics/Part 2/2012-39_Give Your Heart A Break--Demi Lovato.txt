[Verse 1]
The day I first met you, you told me
You'd never fall in love
But now that I get you, I know fear is what it really was

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now here we are
So close, yet so far
Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize, baby, I'm not like the rest?

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
On Sunday, you went home, alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love, but you did not reply
[Pre-Chorus 2]
The world is ours if we want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
When your lips are on my lips
Then our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run, whoa, whoa
[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart (Don't wanna break your heart)
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake (I know you're scared, it's wrong)
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
(Let me give your heart a break)

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away
Some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break (Your heart)
Your heart a break (A break)
Oh yeah, yeah
