[Verse 1]
I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve
Like a big deal
Your love pours down on me
Surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve
Like a big deal
Your love pours down on me
Surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now
[Instrumental Chorus]
