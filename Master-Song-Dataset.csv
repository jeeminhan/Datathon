[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe

You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)

I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus: Gabby Barrett]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope he shows up in a 2 AM pic from a friend
Hanging on to a girl to just rub it in
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then he calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
Let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know he's the one by the end of the night

Tornato con il remix
Questi ragazzi tutti miei figli come Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
La mia città e il mio stato non hanno mai visto questo
Jimmy Neutron, sono un ragazzo prodigio (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
Sul futon, le sto dando quel cazzo
Quando questa merda è pronta, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, come Gilbert Arenas, sparo il colpo
Sono ancora con i demoni, ooh, I keep it thorough
Ho cinque tipe a New York
Questo significa una in ogni quartiere
Sono nel pocket come Burrow
Quando sono tornato a casa, though
Mi trattano come Robert De Niro
La ho portata Taco Bell, le ho comprato un churro
La ho portata a casa, le ho dato un cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year old
Zeri su zeri su zeri (Zeri)
Quello è cosa il bilancio del mio conto bancario dice (Woo)
Ho a check dalla compagnia di scarpe
Ora faccio qualsiasi cosa che dice New Balance
Le ho comprato un biglietto aereo, fuori di stato
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Ho detto, ""Sono in città oggi""
Lei ha detto che she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' quella merda
Così quando she pull up on me so cosa she 'bout to say
[Chorus: Jack Harlow & DaBaby]
Come butta?
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)

Potrei passare quella puttana come Stockton (It ain't nothin')

Sono un vero creativo and stylish, F&N nel mio denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back da L.A. sul jet ieri (Nyoom)
I go back and forth come se giocassi a tennis
Fotto con la tua puttana, yeah, I'm fit for it
Ancora su Billboard, la canzone numero uno nel Regno Unito
And I done got so fuckin' rich, tutte queste puttane sul mio cazzo
Non mi frega ancora un cazzo di cosa mi dicono
Lei lo mangia come Pac-Man, negro (Eat it)
Whoop a nigga come se fossi Batman, negro (Eat it)
I just pulled up nella Batmobile (Nyoom)
La ragione per cui non fotto con questi rap-ass negri
Perché loro sono cap-ass negri (Cap)
E il loro rap non è vero (Cap)
Credimi, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, bisogno di un Squeegee
These niggas watered down, loro bevono Fiji
La mia auto è arancione e marrone come se fossi a Cleveland
La mia puttana è Mello Yello come una soda (Soda)

Hop out that Scat and I caught her
I'm out here with somebody daughter
Lei mi chiama papi, I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it, I will not go kiss it
Or put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler in case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

To make your heart beat better?

Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans

I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe

Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone

We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

You got it, girl, you got it (Oh)
Oh lemme tell you
You got it, girl, you got it
You should deal with a five star nigga
Know you work more than just 6 figures
I'm applying the pressure my finger on the trigger
I know you got a roster just full of hittas
But you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers
Been through so much shit that you don't even know the difference
Made so many mental notes that you can't save a picture
Got so many cuts and bruises I was still invested
Still treat you like the best like KD to the Nets

Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
""Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses""
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper

She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless

CashMoneyAP
Хватай их, хватай их, хватай их, ох
Ох (Я пытаюсь схватить их), ох (Я пытаюсь схватить их)
Ох, ох (Хватай их), ох
Ох (Получаю большой на этом), ох, ох, ох
Ох, ох, ох, ох
Ох, ох, ох
Чего ты хочешь?Не буду говорить тебе дважды, да
Я вор в ночи (Вор в ночи), ох

[Припев: Pop Smoke]
Я сделал что-то не так (О-о), но я всегда прав (О-о)
Сказал, я знаю, как стрелять (О-о) и я знаю, как драться
Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды
Я очень осторожный, как вор в ночи (Смотри)

[Куплет 1: Pop Smoke]
Если я зову тебя деткой, то ты детка на день
Или детка на ночь, ты не моя жена
Она хочет убийцу, чтобы трахаться всю ночь
Я хочу трахаться с тати, соси мне всю ночь
AP, большие камни, на районе с гориллами
Пять K на обед, приношу триста тысяч дилеру
[Припев: Pop Smoke & Lil Baby]
Я сделал что-то не так (О-о), но я всегда прав (О-о)
Сказал, я знаю, как стрелять (О-о) и я знаю, как драться
Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды
Я очень осторожный, как вор в ночи (Бэйби)

[Куплет 2: Lil Baby]
Я богатый, но я катаюсь, у меня мало экзотики, я должен вылететь и получить немного
Ничего не видел, все эти деньги на мне, сотня пачек в сумке, это медовая булочка
Baby OG, я бегал по этим улицам, получил игру из Lashawn
Я сын своей мамы
Выучил о тройном кресте, когда был молодым и я знаю, что не пойду, так что я держу пушку
Я полетел в Париж просто, чтобы купить Dior
Она просит внимания, я не вижу её
C.I.P Pop, я хочу, чтобы ты мог увидеть нас
Я и Cash плюс кто бы то ни был, я иду снова
У получил ниггеров на улице, не побьёшь меня
Я получил индустрию, пытаешься быть мной
Я просто Рэй Чарльз, они не могут увидеть меня
Я в Rolls-Royce с RiRi

[Припев: Pop Smoke & DaBaby]
Я сделал что-то не так (О-о), но я всегда прав (О-о)
Сказал, я знаю, как стрелять (О-о) и я знаю, как драться
Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды
Я реально осторожный, как вор в ночи (Да)
[Куплет 3: DaBaby & Pop Smoke]
Как вор в ночи (Вор)
Я подъехал, дал ей D на ночь (Ах-хах)
Пытаюсь потрахаться в V, это хорошо (Давай трахаться)
Мы не можем испачкать мои сиденья, потому что они белые (Это мои сиденья, смотри на мои сиденья)
Я живу, как в ""Thriller"", я выхожу только ночью
Она не трахается с ликёром, не любит быть выпившей
Она не пьёт Henny, только белое вино (Что она делает?)
Открыл пробку в новом Pinot Grigio (Да)
Подъехал на Porsche с причудливой шлюхой (Зум)
Паркую Porsche и подъезжаю на Lambo (Хмф)
Я выпрыгиваю, Майор Пейн, раскачиваю камуфляж (Да сэр)
Думаю она милая, заставляю её трахаться, дай её мужчине идти (Она милая)
Люблю стрелять, зажигать тебя, сука, я Рембо
Кубинская ссылка полна камней, это чокер (Ох)
Покойся с миром Pop, заставь меня скурить тебя

[Припев: Pop Smoke]
Я сделал что-то не так (О-о), но я всегда прав (О-о)
Сказал, я знаю, как стрелять (О-о) и я знаю, как драться
Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like ""Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh

And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you

I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault
Man, I'm not to blame, man, this fuckin' industry is cutthroat

I got a game plan and I'm out here with the woo!

Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

Yeah
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch, I'm the baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""

When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate

Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)

Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me

Hah

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Slide on it pimp game with my pinky ring
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong words, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan
Aw, Mr. What-Kind-of-Car-He-In?
And the city love my name, nigga, I ain't gotta say it

[Chorus: Tyga]

Lotta girls like me, niggas wanna fight me
Nigga, get your ass checked like a fuckin' Nike
Me not icy, that's unlikely
And she gon' suck me like a fuckin' Hi-C
Aw, chains on the neck for the whole team
And I feel like Gucci with the ice cream
And my bitch want the Fenty, not the Maybelline
I'm the black JB, the way these bitches scream
Make these bitches scream
Ah, pretty little thing
Like my nigga A.E.
Say, ""Yadadadamean""

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

I'm sorry that I let you down

I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud

I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Feels like we're on the edge right now

Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

[Part 1: 6ix9ine]
Muschi ist nass, nass, und es tropft, tropft
Ist eine Spritzpistole, fick sie, sie ist ein Fefe
Ihr Name Keke, sie bläst meinen Schwanz als sei er gratis, gratis
Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so „Wieso habe ich das getan?“
Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so „Wieso habe ich sie gefickt?“
Ich weiß nur, dass ich sie nicht zu meiner Frau machen kann
Bin nett zu ihr, damit sie sich nicht wehrt
Drehe um und fick es von hinten, hinten, hinten
Beuge sie runter und lass es klatschen, klatschen, klatschen

[Hook: 6ix9ine]
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde, nein

[Part 2: 6ix9ine]
Draco hat den Rückstoß, wenn ich schieße, werden sie zu Leichtathleten
Sie schießen nicht zurück, ein Schuss, Nahdistanz, roter Punkt
Kopf platzt, ja, ich hab's getan, ja, das ist mein Leben
Rufe einen Uber mit meinen Schützen, mit einem Ruger, wir erledigen dich
Typen sagen, sie töten Leute, doch ich tu es wirklich
[Hook: 6ix9ine]
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde, nein

[Part 3: Nicki Minaj]
Er-Er will 69 wie Tekashi, nenn' ihn Papi
Shoutout an A$AP, halte mich mit Diamanten bestückt, ich komme aus New York, also bin ich frech
Sagt, er mag meine Bande, kaufte mir Chloé wie Kardashi
Hält meine Muschi in Versace, sagte ich bin schön so wie Tinashe
Halt-Halte es alles in sein Gesicht, wurde ich angeklagt?
Soeben ist jemand meinem Pussy-Game erlitten, doch ich hinterlasse nie eine Spur
Gesicht so schön, Arsch langt für Tage, ich bekomme Chips, ich frage nach Lay's
Ich lehne mich nur zurück, wenn er fertig ist und frage, „Wie hat es geschmeckt?“
(Yo, wie hat es geschmeckt?)

[Refrain: 6ix9ine]
Ich will nicht wirklich keine Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich keine Freunde, nein

[Part 4: Nicki Minaj]
Ey yo, Draco hat den Rückstoß
Wenn es zurückstoßt bekommst du deine Sachen nicht mehr wieder
Genau genommen bin ich diese Bitch, diese
„Ich hasse Smalltalk, Plaudereinen kümmern mich nicht“
Klimaanlage hat aufgehört zu funktionieren
Also rufen sie mich, sagten mir ich solle mein Handgelenk zurückbringen
Komme hin, Mode tragend
Bringe jede Bitch dazu zu sagen, „Yo, was ist das?“

Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you

I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('Cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)

Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say

Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke

Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""

I am his, and he is mine

My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

We turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I —
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever
You know?
We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?

Детка, мне нравится твой стиль

[Куплет 1: Drake]
Обхватил твою талию, спереди, сзади
Ты знаешь, что я не играю
Улицы опасны, но я никогда не сбегаю
Даже когда я в отъезде
Нет, нет
На самом деле любви нет, когда ты в дороге
Я молюсь о том, чтобы вернуться целиком
Я молюсь, молюсь

Мне нужен один танец
Держу в руке Хеннесси
Последний раз, прежде чем я уйду
Высшие силы овладевают мной
Мне нужен один танец
Держу в руке Хеннесси
Последний раз, прежде чем я уйду
Высшие силы овладевают мной

[Рефрен: Kyla]
Детка, мне нравится твой стиль
[Куплет 2: Drake]
Силу и поддержку
Это всё, что желаю друзьям
Никто не добивается успеха из моего района
Мне пришлось нарушить тишину
Ты знаешь, тебе нужно быть рядом со мной
Как только увидишь сообщение, ответь мне
Не хочу тратить время на споры
У нас нет на это времени, так что

[Припев: Drake]
Мне нужен один танец
У меня в руке Хеннесси
Еще раз, прежде чем я пойду
Высшие силы овладевают мной
Мне нужен один танец
У меня в руке Хеннесси
Еще раз, прежде чем я пойду
Высшие силы овладевают мной

[Постприпев: Wizkid]
Заполучил красивую девушку, и она давно любит меня
Танцы, танцы, она давно любит меня
Оу, да, очень давно
Назад, назад, назад и танцы
Назад, назад и танцы, детка
Назад, назад, назад и танцы
Оу, да, очень давно
Назад, назад и танцы, детка
[Бридж: Kyla]
Оу, скажи мне, мне нужно знать
Куда ты хочешь пойти?
Ведь если ты согласишься, я сделаю это медленно
Заставляя тебя потерять контроль

[Брейкдаун: Kyla и Wizkid]
Куда, куда, куда
Куда, куда, куда, куда (Оу, да, очень давно)
Куда, куда, куда (Назад, назад и танцы, детка)
Куда, куда, куда, куда
Ведь если тебе плохо (Назад, назад и–)
Ведь если тебе плохо (Назад, назад и–)
Ведь если тебе плохо (Назад, назад и–)

[Припев: Drake и Kyla]
Мне нужен один танец (Куда, куда, куда)
Держу в руке Хеннесси (Куда, куда, куда, куда)
Последний раз, прежде чем я уйду (Куда)
Высшие силы овладевают мной (Куда, куда, куда, куда)
Мне нужен один танец
Держу в руке Хеннесси
Последний раз, прежде чем я уйду
Высшие силы овладевают мной

Как пишется «Хеннесси»?
Я поставил две «Н» и две «С», это как? Хен... Хенн... Хенн...

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)

Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus]
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
[Verse 3]
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

[Bridge]
Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

[Chorus]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
[Breakdown]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

[Chorus]
Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""

[Verse 3]
Welcome to my duck-off, the crib, the spot, the pad
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home's draining the sad
Soon as these happy faces land you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown pass
Mi casa es tu casa, so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax

I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
[Chorus]
Now you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this

[Bridge]
I took a plane to my hometown
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize (Size, size)

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Verse 2]
""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?
[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Bridge]
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time

But no one's ever left me quite this sore

Nos lo tomamos con calma, pero no es lo típico
El ya sabe que mi amor es fuego
Su corazón era una piedra, pero entonces, sus manos deambulaban
Le convertí en oro y eso le hizo feliz

Bueno, seré tu fantasía, seré tus cosas favoritas
Podríamos ser hermosos
Emborracharnos de la buena vida, te llevaré al paraíso
Di que nunca me dejarás ir

[Coro]
En lo profundo de mis huesos, puedo sentirte
Regrésame a un tiempo que solo nosotros conocimos
Un escondite
Podríamos pasar la noche viеndo una película antigua
Fumar algo de hierba еn mi sofá en la habitación de atrás
Un escondite

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song
[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien  with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
[Bridge]
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

[Chorus]

Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?

Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone
I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye

I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

Saturday mornin', jumped outta bed and put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet all the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand to ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' till the day I die
""Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!""

[Chorus]
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Yeah, no matter what you say
(Marry that girl) And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?

[Verse 2]
I hate to do this, you leave no choice, can't live without her
Love me or hate me, we will be both standin' at that altar
Or we will run away to another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me, she will go anywhere I go
[Pre-Chorus]
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places

'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night

So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat

[Verse 1]
I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

[Pre-Chorus]
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
[Verse 2]
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us

[Pre-Chorus]
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?

[Bridge]
Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?
Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?

[Pre-Chorus]
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
(Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?)
Grey clouds roll over the hills bringing darkness from above
(Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?)
[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
If you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried

Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door

It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray

Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long

You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation

Oh, baby, why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

Thi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh

Nós estamos a milhares de milhas do conforto
Percorremos a terra e o mar mas enquanto você está comigo
Não há nenhum lugar que eu preferiria estar
Eu esperaria para sempre, animado com a cena
Enquanto eu estou com você meu coração continua a bater

[Pré-Coro]
A cada passo que damos, Kyoto em The Bay
Passeando tão casualmente, nós somos diferentes e iguais
Dei-lhe outro nome, mude as baterias

[Coro]
Se você me dessе uma chance eu iria levá-la, é um tiro no еscuro
Mas vou fazê-lo, saiba com todo o seu coração
Você não pode me envergonhar, quando eu estou com você
Não há nenhum lugar que eu preferiria estar
N-não, não, não, não há lugar que eu preferiria estar

[Verso 2]
Nós, demarcados em uma missão
Para encontrar a nossa paz interior
Torná-lo eterno para que nada é incompleto
É fácil estar com você, simplicidade sagrado
Enquanto estamos juntos
Não há nenhum lugar que eu preferiria estar

She been plottin' on me for a cool minute
She wanna' suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like girls in the shower, when it's winter fresh
It’s some Twitter pussy, I met on the Internet
On my late-night thirsty, ‘cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no bailin'
I keep a stack of hundreds, I can keep a secret
If anything you was explorin', you wasn’t cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin' game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho

And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it

'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me

Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me?
When I just wanna make you smile?

I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

Baby, you're so classic (Baby you)
Baby, you're so classic
[Verse 2: Tony Oller]
Four dozen roses, anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you, doing it Sinatra style

Keep it real to real in the way I feel

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye & Kimbra]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ahhh)
And I don't even need your love (Oooh)
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (Ahhh)

And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it

The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

That without them, you feel like nothing

So that you could have the good

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

Watched it pour as I touched your face

And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time

That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yes I can, doubt better leave, I'm runnin' with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip?
Like you the one drinking what God sip—dot com
Now I got a word for your tongue
How many rolling stones you want?
Yeah I got a brand new spirit
Speaking it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, U.S. to Taiwan
Now who can say that? I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach
I got a feeling it's a rap, ASAP

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
The mountain top, walk on water
I got power, feel so royal
One second I'ma strike all you
Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Got adrenaline, never giving in
Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness, I got the heart of twenty men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates, take a genius to understand me
[Chorus: Etta James]

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love

And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you, instead, they say

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Wanz","To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100. ""All of the Lights"" - Kanye West 99. ""No Lie"" - 2 Chainz feat. Drake 98.

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees (Shit)
So what we go out? (Ayy, lemme get a lighter, please?)
That's how it's supposed to be ('Cause you know I'm high as fuck and I forgot one)
Living young and wild and free (Keep that in there)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I'm on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it

And we gon' fight and we gon' roll

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, I love you

But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind

White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks

I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too

We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
[Post-Chorus]
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now

Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (At us)

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock

And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time when you fade to the blacknеss
And when you're staring at the phonе in your lap

And when your plans unravel in the sand

Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah back when I was trying to get a tip at subway
And back then I was rapping for the hell of it
But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant
I'm guessing if can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hoping we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Verse 2: Eminem] You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em? You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em? You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Verse 3: Eminem] Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna— [Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'

Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine

But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, ""Nicki don't stop, you the bestest""
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

[Verse 4: Drake]
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, ""Shake'n Bake"" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment
[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile

You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong

Verse 1:
They overdosing on my swag
Put the whole god damn hood in rehab
Too many rumples in my duffle
Can't close this bag its so much cash
I need 10 hands now to count my stash
LL Cool Gucci Mane I'm back
Never need a mask best check my stash
You must be hall-u-cin-a-tin
1st day out girl ain't you glad?
6 supermodels crashing at my pad
I should be a model drinking outta gold bottles
With some tru religion jeans sagging off my ass
Please don't crash am I goin' to fast
Touchdown anywhere I don't need no pass
Might need some gum cause I'm finna talk trash
Cuz keep em on task like a kid at class
Hater can't hit what a hater can't see
Untouchable these haters sure can't see me
He wouldn't know a hit if you hit him in the head
With a 4 by 4 standing 6 foot 3
Ready for a bitch, crocodile dun sheet
Never met a girl I ain't fuck first week
You never seem a g throw a 10,000 white mink
On the floor live on B.E.T (Gucci)
[Hook]
I only got life I can live
There's only so much game I can give
So you could watch the show chillin' at your crib
And weeks turn to months, and months turn to years
But I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes
Ima ball today, wake up, then go ball some more
Can't tell a grown man what to do with his
It's your prerogative Ima mind my biz
But Ima live the life, forever rocking ice
Throwing money popping bottles cause that's just what I like
(x2)

Verse 2:
Screaming I'mma be like the Black Eyed Peas
I wanna be free and you wanna be me
Best eased if you really want beef
Ima fight you by the trees looking like swiss cheese
Just came home ain't thinking bout sleep
Bitch ya favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks
Thinkin' bout me like I'm down the street
Know it's over soon as my feet touch concrete
Pull up in South Beach blowing on trees
Whipping down the street like I'm riding on D's
A new ferrari flying down Peachtree
Girl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please
Make sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed
Niggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means
You wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend
Starting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16
My whole life changed, now it's so icy
1st album on the charts came out same week (Gucci)
[Hook]

Verse 3:
My auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak, wrote me every week real talk thats deep
Ex-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033
It's my son's birthday my boy turned 3, and looking at him is like looking at me
Can't look back and watch the moves I make
But the moves that I made fuck around and move me

Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos (Dimelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley
Labor Day Parade—rest in peace, Bob Marley

Long live the king, yo—I'm from the Empire State, that's

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho

And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid

I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and
Read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse, he's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap (Rap)
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Verse 2]
Won't listen to any advice
Mama's tellin' me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

[Verse 3]
Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug?
Your drug
Huh, your drug

Lit up the world as I fell asleep

That planet Earth turns slowly

As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre

So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

[Verse 1]
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My love of my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right

[Verse 2]
When I be riding man I swear I see her face at every turn
Trying to get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
More and more, I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone
And you wishing you could give them everything

I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility

[Chorus]
And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And baby, your love is gonna change me

And now I can see every single possibility

Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not going in
Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

[Chorus]
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

[Verse 2]
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:
[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Ohh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say I love you enough?
Till it's to late, it's not too late

[Verse 2]
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
[Verse 2]
And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
'Cause when we long for absolution
There'll no one on the line, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start

Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""Give me back my swag,"" they tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames
Louis belt, what that make me, Louis Mane?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be to 'em

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)

Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking 'round thinking I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)
(filter; from walkie-talkie)
Blow whose brains out?

5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT
TIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the
jutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in
the whole of the statue's head.
RINGLEADER (O.S.)
(a nasty laugh)
Lady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!

6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY
MOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.

SWAT COP
Sons of bitches.

SWAT CAPTAIN
Relax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out
first.

SWAT COP II
Captain . . . what the hell is that?

All eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from
the clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head
of the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:

SWAT CAPTAIN
Shit.  Shit fire!!

SWAT COP
Sir!  What is it?
7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS
A magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic,
blimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.

SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)
Christ almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!

8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
In the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold
suited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting
inkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.

NIGHT OWL
Okay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?

He looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT,
blond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:

VEIDT
(on monitor)
Let's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.

9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY
A line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a
thud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.

10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
TERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows
nothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his
walkie-talkie:

RINGLEADER
Hey.  We got a problem here --

He releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.

RINGLEADER
Come in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us,
Goddammit !

11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT
The SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared,
he glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic
frenzy.

SWAT COP
Ignorant bastards!  They've jammed us!

SWAT COP II
What do we do now?

SWAT CAPTAIN
We sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.

12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water.
There's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he
swaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to
reveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.

Superhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather
breastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it
matches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.

13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of
the statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is
fumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone
haywire.

TERRORIST I
Base to head.  Base to head.  Come in!
(flustered)
I can't get shit!

TERRORIST II
What the hell is going on??

There's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison --
just as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.

Panic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of
a long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to
his head.

TERRORIST I
I'M NOT JOKING!!

The COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED
SHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice
and he slumps to the floor, stone dead.

The TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too
stunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --

COMEDIAN
The joke's on you.

-- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As
the saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.

14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor
of the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --

15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
A sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to
the nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL
FIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.

While the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point
behind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS
and RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the
statue's upraised TORCH.

The TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the
far side of the torch.

RINGLEADER
I don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.

16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY
RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.

RORSCHACH
Got your flashgun?

CAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and
goes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits
behind.

17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
The COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout.
He spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,
then strolls over and jimmies it open.

ANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different.
This one's a WOMAN.

SILK SPECTRE
About time.  It stinks down there.

COMEDIAN
B-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.

As the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched
wetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME
underneath.

SILK SPECTRE
Why do I get all the glamour jobs?

COMEDIAN
A woman's work is never done.

18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY
The TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,
CAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their
guns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a
TEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.

RINGLEADER
I don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.

CAPT. METROPOLIS
Please.  There's something I'd like you to see first.

He holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash.
All at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding
light has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the
floor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.

All except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses.
He pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.

19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER
An edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed
from behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at
his throat.

COMEDIAN
Okay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?

20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
Everyone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the
TERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.

CAPT. METROPOLIS
Don't cry, little one.  You're in good hands.
(standing; to the crowd)
Now everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.

He goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the
torch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.

21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER
A METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH
secures it to the tip of the torch.

22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT
SILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.

SILK SPECTRE
Should be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .

COMEDIAN
Just barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their
balls off.

They look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead
landing.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist
hits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the
landing.

23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER
Gas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits
in a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with
UNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the
COMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:

COMEDIAN
Well.  They look distracted.
(turning to face her)
Don't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?

SILK SPECTRE
Eddie -- !

Suddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He
turns.

One of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself
over to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A
SWITCH on the housing.

A TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.

COMEDIAN
SHIT!

He hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to
blink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An
empty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.

SILK SPECTRE
What about the --

COMEDIAN
FUCK 'EM!

There's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it
around the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only
a second before following suit.

24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
CAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,
he FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as
well.

25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
YET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel.
He looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.

NIGHT OWL
Adrian!

VEIDT
Yeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.

NIGHT OWL
Well, good God, we can't just --

VEIDT
Mission aborted, Daniel!

NIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.

26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT
On the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.

27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER
The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS
throwing off sparks against the cable.

28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
CAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands
pressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and
RORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off
the torch.

29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
THE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE
touches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator
doors open, and the two of them dive through.

30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER
RORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP
streaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure
of Lady Liberty.

Three beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.

31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
A heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an
overhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.

32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER
Smoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat
against a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling
DEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.

33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER
The furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of
the statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He
turns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.

SWAT CAPTAIN
That's it.  I quit.

The water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --

34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY
-- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through
the harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the
demolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes
wondering what the hell happened to his date.

Meet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.
MANHATTAN.

Down below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --
are crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge
blue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:

COMEDIAN
ASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?

CUT TO:

35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT
The Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.

SHEILA
In the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has
revoked its contract with Adrian Veidt's super-team.  Local police
have threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the
Watchmen are dropped.

On the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars
surround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.

JIM
And in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which
would ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage
is expected.
(shuffling his papers)
Well, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially
history.

TIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather

warning the clocks EXPLODE.  As gears and coils and crystals cascade

37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT
Darkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT
UP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP
drifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo
faint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where
heavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED
PLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:

NEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER

38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by
the garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the
high-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated
bubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on
their roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.

A CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: ""NEW SKIRMISH ON
AFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.""

CUSTOMER
Crazy reds don't know who they're messing with.
(indicating the cop cars)
What happened over there?

NEWS VENDOR
Some guy went sidewalk divin'  Twenny-five cents.

39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT
A riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from
the DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare
with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.

PATROLMAN
STAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!

We are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of
reality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the
city -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:
his standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his
plastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears
a path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the
back of a waiting ambulance.

DET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and
buttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the
investigation.

BURNS
Had a lot of blood in him.

HYDE
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.

BURNS
No idea who's behind this?

HYDE
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.

BURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.

BURNS
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a
call from Washington.

HYDE
Washington?

BURNS
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.

HYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after
the ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.

40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON a large placard: ""THE END IS NIGH.""  The bearer of the sign,
a hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk
spreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make
out an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.

The NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his
collar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against
the kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,
cross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in
response and plugs on.

At the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the
sidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET
CRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain
grate.

It's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its
surface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to
midnight.

The STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the
shattered window some forty stories above.

DISSOLVE TO:

41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
CAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted
corridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading
""POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.""  At the far end is a single door,
SEALED OFF.

42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
MOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and
overturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture
window.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are
flapping wildly.

A ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.

SHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps
inside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is
invisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the
room.

The apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,
gaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The
flashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS
and an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.

The INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains
of a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky
glass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for
his face.

He has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and
ever-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should
be. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.

We've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.

43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
RORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk
dainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.
Offhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.
He tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his
trenchcoat pocket.

44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
The beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls,
and settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet.
RORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive
suits.

He shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on
the wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.
THUMP.

He pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully
along the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a
CONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing
a SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.

He reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a
bizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,
rows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed
PHOTOGRAPH.

RORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman,
all dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is
wearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's
costume.

They're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.
METROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH
himself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we

DISSOLVE TO:

45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT
A LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner
store.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with
the heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated
-- old before his time.

He holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough
to open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.

46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT
In an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in
progress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in
knot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG
sees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious
decision to move on.  Then --

VOICE
Hold up, papa-san!

The KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and
spotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they
march toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,
almost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we

CUT TO:

47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE
Slow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the
gimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place
in a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.

It's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in
an alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of
fists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--

-- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,
transporting us back to:

48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT
Real-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF
WHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the
alley.

LOUDSPEAKER
HALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --

The KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the
LIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair
some forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of
the kids.

DREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the
alleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past
help.

49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The
security system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's
apartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.

DREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs
it carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for
the kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most
peculiar sight:

DREIBERG
. . . Rorschach.

50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Leaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is
the aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,
exposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of
baked beans.

DREIBERG
How did you get in here?

Ignoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,
utterly emotionless whisper:

RORSCHACH
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.

DREIBERG
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?

DREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less --
emits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can
onto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup
from a squeeze bottle.

DREIBERG (cont.)
I can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're
wanted on fourteen counts of murder.

RORSCHACH
At least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.

He reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it
to DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his
fingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Look familiar?

DREIBERG
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.

RORSCHACH
Human bean juice.
(beat)
The Comedian is dead.

DREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.
His jaw goes slack.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Had a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --
beautiful view.
Hope he enjoyed it on the way down.

DREIBERG
Jesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?

RORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.

DREIBERG (cont.)
Well, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he
must've had enemies.

RORSCHACH
So do I.  So do you.

DREIBERG
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just
paranoia.

RORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG
blinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But
RORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the
front door.

RORSCHACH
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with
a grudge.
(pause)
Thought you might want to spread the word.

DREIBERG
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?

RORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He
opens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.

RORSCHACH
You the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.

He reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo
from the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.

DREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,
CAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple
tunic and mask . . .

51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT
A GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is
far from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome
desk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is
ADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's
DREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and
pale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.

VEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic
patents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his
office reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the
like.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE
RINGS.

VEIDT
Veidt here.

52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT
DREIBERG
Adrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.
I had to call you before he --

VEIDT
Daniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?

DREIBERG
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.

VEIDT
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?

DREIBERG
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's
. . . I don't know, stalking us.

VEIDT
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.

The big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red
fur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a
chunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders
DREIBERG's words.

VEIDT (cont.)
Daniel, Rorschach is insane.

DREIBERG
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells
blood.

VEIDT
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs
-- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.

DREIBERG
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at
this late date.

VEIDT
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected
you.  Haven't I?
(slight pause)
Do you need money?

DREIBERG
No.  I just wanted you to --

VEIDT
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good
night.

DREIBERG
Good night.

VEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a
cigarette.  It's ""matchless""; you ignite it guy striking the tip of
the cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a
long, slow drag.

CUT TO:

53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
Barbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the
checkpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE
rolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign
which reads ""ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.""

54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
ADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED
ESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door
with a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a
six-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .

. . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple
doorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and
wait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.

The inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned
woman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK
SPECTRE.

LAURIE
Adrian.

VEIDT
Laurie!  Good to see you.

She gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall
in perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.

LAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized
machines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific
paraphernalia of every description.

VEIDT (cont.)
Nice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?

LAURIE
Don't rub it in.  I live here.

VEIDT
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?

LAURIE
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.

She takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT
wanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A
SMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:

VEIDT
Hi, Jon.

DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)
(a deep, booming voice)
Hello, Adrian.

DR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under
any circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan.
Forty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a
calibration atop his particle accelerator.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
I think I'm about to detect a gluino.

In case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just
about anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the
physical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of
time and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.

Any government would be glad to have him.

VEIDT
Supersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann
caught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .

LAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.

LAURIE
Please, you guys, no shop talk.
(to DR. MANHATTAN)
Jon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?

DR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable
six-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist
-- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:

LAURIE (cont.)
Good to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?

He tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.

VEIDT
. . . Are we being monitored?

DR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the
little red ""ON"" lights wink out.

DR. MANHATTAN
The bearer of bad news.

VEIDT
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.

LAURIE
Blake?  Dead?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the
funeral as a matter of protocol.

LAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first
she's heard about it.

VEIDT
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to
think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen.

DR. MANHATTAN
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.

VEIDT
What's your theory?

DR. MANHATTAN
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern
me.

VEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is
considerably less amused.

LAURIE
I could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?

VEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another
part of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as
we watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and
floats off to one side.

A module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of
the hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in
midair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and
reassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.

VEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes
the conversation without missing a beat:

VEIDT
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.

DR. MANHATTAN
You mean Afghanistan?
(beat)
It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more
interesting.

The module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The
cover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws
itself shut.

VEIDT
Well . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as
usual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye,
Jon.

DR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds
his coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she
arrives with two stiff drinks in hand.

LAURIE
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --

VEIDT
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.

LAURIE
Please.

There's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his
shoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing
with his superaccelerator.

VEIDT
He's a little farther gone every time.

LAURIE
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to
someone human.
(beat)
He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I
mean -- he even scares the research teams.

VEIDT
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed
the world.

LAURIE
(embarrassed)
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's
doing his work --

VEIDT
What about you?

LAURIE
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.
(pause)
I'll ring for the guards.

She goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,
concerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest
pocket for a cigarette case:

VEIDT
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.
(handing her a cigarette)
Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give
Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.

LAURIE
Maybe I'll do that.

VEIDT
I'm sorry about Blake.

He pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS
appear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.

LAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman
lover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and
WALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.

CUT TO:

55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
A decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,
popular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow
stairway which dips well below street level.

56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT
The usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS
hover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS
stand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and
grind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.

Over by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE
off the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of
vicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the
bar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing
glasses.

RORSCHACH
Harry.

HARRY
(petrified)
R-Rorschach.

RORSCHACH
Phone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?

He reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH
picks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS
and yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.

He turns and faces the assembled multitudes:

RORSCHACH
Edward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had
help.
(wandering through the room)
Thought maybe you could fill me in.

ENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as
RORSCHACH strolls past.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
You.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?
(moving on)
Johnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?

Behind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively
toward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,
yanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Nicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?

NICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH
extends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --

-- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He
closes a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and
SNAPS IT.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Edward Blake.  Who killed him?

No answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH
grabs his index finger and repeats the process.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Who killed Edward Blake?

NICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to
the floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let
fly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.

VOICE
JESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!

RORSCHACH
THE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?

By now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.
Without looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It
catches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of
glassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the
ceiling.

SILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He
looks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
So many vermin . . . so little time.

He bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it
contemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long
enough to HISS at the crowd:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Go back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be
around.


CUT TO:

57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN
The bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller
research complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and
LAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over
to where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is
empty.

LAURIE
(muttering; groggy)
Jon . . . ?

A LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE
closes her eyes and sighs.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm here, Laurie.

LAURIE
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?

DR. MANHATTAN
Not yet, there's plenty of time.

A SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.
DR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.

LAURIE
Mmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?

The BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm,
toward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.

DR. MANHATTAN
Would you like me to stay?

LAURIE
Mm hmm.

DR. MANHATTAN
I could stay and go.

LAURIE
. . . And just how would you manage that?

She leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its
downward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is
massaging LAURIE's thigh.

Third blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly
wide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.

DR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the
foot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.

LAURIE
AAAAAAAAAA!!

DR. MANHATTAN I
Laurie?  Are you --

DR. MANHATTAN II
Don't be upset.

This unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's
fragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a
dressing gown.

LAURIE
Jon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one
person again, please?

The big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical
gestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.

DR. MANHATTAN I
Laurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --

DR. MANHATTAN II
-- you would find it erotic.

LAURIE
All right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy
in this place, I --

While fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance
through a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,
she sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an
experiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through
the door . . .

58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER
. . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:

LAURIE
You've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your
stupid experiments --

DR. MANHATTAN III
Yes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.

LAURIE
So you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how
could you do this?

DR. MANHATTAN III
You seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case?
(pause)
I thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.

LAURIE
That's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you
can --

She doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered
the room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:

DR. MANHATTANS I & II
Laurie, please --

LAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back
slowly, steadies herself on a lab table.

LAURIE
Jon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I
could really use the time alone.

She storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &
II -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original
DR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his
equipment.

FADE THROUGH TO:

1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT
A pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard
at work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly
beautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely
wasted on her preoccupied date.

At the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:

LAURIE
The government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I
guess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman.
(mock-macho)
I have to keep him in line.

She flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to
laugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has
wandered off into a far corner of the room.

LAURIE (cont.)
Excuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?

DREIBERG
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think
anyone's out to get us -- do you?

LAURIE
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no
Mother Teresa.

DREIBERG
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .

LAURIE
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the
government or do time.

DREIBERG
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty
tricks -- political assassinations --

Now he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then
leans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:

LAURIE
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us
made other choices.

DREIBERG
(shaking his head in disgust)

Yeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors
. . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.

LAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.

DREIBERG (cont.)
What's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?

LAURIE
I'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could
see yourself right now.
(raising her glass)
Well, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . .
and we're not.

DREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.

1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,
which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters
of brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.

DREIBERG
The pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I
mean, we were heroes!

LAURIE
Damn straight.

DREIBERG
Damn straight!  We were heroes.

LAURIE
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.

DREIBERG
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the
world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .

LAURIE
(smiling)
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?
What was his name . . .

DREIBERG
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd
beat him up?

LAURIE
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?

DREIBERG
(deadpan)
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an
elevator shaft.

LAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to
her mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA
PULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a
stentorian VOICE over scene:

CHAPLAIN (V.O.)
In the midst of life we are in death . . .

CUT TO:

59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY
AN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.

CHAPLAIN
. . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall
change our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --

TIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of
mourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the
attendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons
of protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off
with the traditional twenty-one gun salute.

CHAPLAIN (cont.)
-- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all
things unto himself.

A light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.
MANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish
miraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the
distance, and he glances off at:

60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT
SENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the
cemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has
been spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like
wildfire.

MOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the
cemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due
respect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo:
gawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their
hands full managing the crowd.

A KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to
join the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the
VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.

It's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled
marble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,
and he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,
Pieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze
plaque bears the inscription:

IN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS
WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES
TO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM

Below it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four
hundred of them.

61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
The Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet
home.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her
through.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind
her, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.

62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT
LAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,
fumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the
card into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.

She tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls
up behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps
out.

LAURIE
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.

ADAMSON
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.

LAURIE
Why?  What's the problem?

ADAMSON
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.

LAURIE
(chuckling)
I would like to use the bathroom --

As she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.

ADAMSON
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.

LAURIE
What?!

ADAMSON
Please.

The major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The
GUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.

ADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she
sees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.

The entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging
from it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION
SUITS.

63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT
LAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to
a team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard
at the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white
gown:

NURSE
Miss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.

LAURIE
What -- ?

DOCTOR
Drink this.

The DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She
stares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.

DOCTOR
Drink it.

64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT
TECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are
shifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of
a human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens
on:

65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT
We're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A
donut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,
foot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to
the anteroom.

Through a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head
wedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right
as she wonders just what the hell is going on.

66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
A MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.

LAURIE (O.S.)
That's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.

LAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table
surrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent
SCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken
from a thick sheaf.

LAURIE (cont.)
Dr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The
quantum-whatever.

SCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the
Watchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE
hesitates.

LAURIE (cont.)
That's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.
(long pause)
Rorschach . . .

SCHMIDT
Their real names, please.

LAURIE
I don't know their real names.

SCHMIDT
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.

LAURIE
I don't know their real names!

SCHMIDT
You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on
the answers you give.
(holding up the sheaf of photos)
These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --

LAURIE
Then why don't you ask him?!?

Furious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby
window.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced
torturers, they understand the value of patience.

LAURIE (cont.)
I want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.

One of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out
for LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door
opens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.

He passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and
tilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with
curiosity:

LAURIE (cont.)
Someone had better tell me what's going on here!

SCHMIDT
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file
are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else
in common as well.
(beat)
They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.

LAURIE
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?

All at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes
bone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she
takes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.

SCHMIDT
I'm terribly sorry.

LAURIE
What does this mean?  What does it --

SCHMIDT
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can
see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.

LAURIE
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible
joke to make me --

She scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to
his comrades, and heads for the door.

SCHMIDT
Take a day or two.  If you ""remember"" any names . . . do give us a
call.

The AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches
for the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,
she buries her face in her hands.

67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
A darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a
two-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been
watching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.

ADAMSON
Poor kid.

SCHMIDT
We'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.

ADAMSON
To hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc
Manhattan.

SCHMIDT
What do you mean?

ADAMSON
She's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows
which way he'll jump.

DISSOLVE TO:

68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY
DR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing
a navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie
with an irregular mauve pattern.

The tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie
magically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal
gold stripes.

Too staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into
a handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for
decoration.

It does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the
mirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.

69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY
TECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green
room, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.

DIRECTOR
We're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is
that big blue son of a --

He stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just
rematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's
face.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry.  Am I late?

DIRECTOR
No problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm
Kent Turner, the director. . .

The DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a
hallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.

LIAISON
Dr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to
steer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll
just play it cool --

DIRECTOR
Doc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give
us something a little darker . . . ?

DR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.

DR. MANHATTAN
Will this do?

DIRECTOR
Perfect.

LIAISON
Now Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --

But the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by
a cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are
hurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON
hangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The ""ABC NEWS
SPECIAL REPORT"" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC
underneath.

70. INSERT - TV MONITOR
Stock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for
their lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right
and takes in an extraordinary sight.

A towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through
the jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the
greenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts
of automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation
crew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:
""VIETNAM.  1965.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Dr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific
mishap.  For more than twenty years the ""Manhattan Option"" has been
the linchpin of America's conventional strategy --

We CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad
thoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds
a corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.

His EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey
gunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM
hisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met
with a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:
""CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)
-- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a
one-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding
the Communist menace in check.

DANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from
American Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake
hands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a
three-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic
accord.  Title: ""NICARAGUA.  1979.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)
In the famous words of General William Westmoreland, ""Yes, Virginia,
there is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American.""

71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
A sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop
of the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded
news vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:

BRINKLEY
For this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by
correspondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,
I'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.
(turning)
Now let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better
known to the world as Dr. Manhattan.

Applause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at
BRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.

BRINKLEY (cont.)
I suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan,
where Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now
since you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .
. . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that
you intervene?

DR. MANHATTAN
I will not intervene in Afghanistan.

A HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.

72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
Looking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.

73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN
HANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.
BRINKLEY ignores them:

BRINKLEY
You're saying you would refuse a direct request?

DR. MANHATTAN
There will be no request.  I will not intervene.

BRINKLEY
Well, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can
actually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the
hostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?

74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
He's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on
DR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE
in the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:

LIAISON
I want a phone line to the booth.  Now.

75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN
DR. MANHATTAN
I see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.
(long pause)
I can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will
not intervene.

He sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.

BRINKLEY
Well, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll
open up the floor to questions now.  Doug?

REPORTER
Dr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read
you some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.
Weaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?

DR. MANHATTAN
All friends, yes.  Associates of mine.

ROTH
Let me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.
Are you aware that these ""friends"" and ""associates"" of yours have all
been diagnosed with terminal cancer?

The CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He
gapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face
an unreadable mask.

76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
eyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone

LIAISON
Oh Jesus.
(barking into phone)
I want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I
have to!

77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN
ROTH
I have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly
diagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a
connection?

By now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make
himself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message
from the booth, touches his headset and announces:

BRINKLEY
I'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief
message --

Within seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,
flanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.

LIAISON
THAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!

The three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,
PANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB
THE SET.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
Dr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause
cancer??

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't wish to answer any questions.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
You see the future!  Did you know in advance --

LIAISON
The Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP
ASIDE!!

The LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but
the mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
How long have you known -- why is the government concealing this
information --

DR. MANHATTAN
Please get out of my way.

The LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.
SCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN
lets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:

DR. MANHATTAN
I said LEAVE ME ALONE!!

In the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no
microphones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.
MANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.

BRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,
there's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,
leaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.

CUT TO:

78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
The place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is
overseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post
quarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised
when DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.

DR. MANHATTAN
Where's Laurie?

ADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and
he's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely
necessary.

ADAMSON
She's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .

DR. MANHATTAN
There's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the
results positive?

ADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
Don't bother.  I already know what you'll say.

He watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His
mind is already a million miles away.

ADAMSON
Jon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .
could you cure her?

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't know.  I only know that I won't.
(long pause)
There'd be no point.  It's finally begun.

ADAMSON
""Begun?""  What's begun?

DR. MANHATTAN
I've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years.
(pause)
You see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I
cared for . . .

ADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down
his spine nonetheless.

DR. MANHATTAN
My work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.

And with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves
behind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at
the Major's feet.

ADAMSON
Good Lord --

CUT TO:

79. EXT. OUTER SPACE
-- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few
hundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily
apparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily
beautiful
-- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white
clouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing
our planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.

It's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on
nothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.
Stars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to
leave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.

80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT
Black sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so
barren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,
until we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined
quonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,
half-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than
husks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a
rotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.

A gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden
RUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue
light.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift
in the sky and descends gently to earth.

The rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once
more as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town
of Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was
once a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long
mahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.

A desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We
MOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and

DISSOLVE TO:

81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY
It's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN
-- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie
and a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing
a dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:

JANEY SLATER (O.S.)
Nineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they
could at least make us a decent hamburger.

JON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten
with DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple
of years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just
close enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's
probably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush
JON has on her.

JON
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna
head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.

JANEY
With lots of ketchup?

Smiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a
bottle on his french fries.

JON
Nothing wrong with ketchup.

JANEY
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug
like you doing in a place like this?

JON
Anything for science, I guess.
(long, hesitant pause)
Janey, there's something --

JANEY
(simultaneously)
We should get back --
(realizing she's cut him off)
What?

JON
Nothing.  What were you going to say?

JANEY
We should get back to the lab.
(staring at him; chuckling)
You okay, Jon?

He stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he
pipes up:

JON
Oh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.

The lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads
for the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after
JANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.

His face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up
behind her.

JANEY
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --

JON
(blurting it out)
Janey, will you marry me?

She turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the
pained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the
verdict.

JANEY
Jon -- what?

JON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes
locked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the
canteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the
door, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and
one of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled
JANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.

There's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private
trance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.

WALLY
Christ, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.

JANEY
Oh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --

JON
I can fix it.

JANEY
-- What?

JON
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better
than ever.

He holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.

WALLY
Take him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.

Chuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY
hands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her
with basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his
answer.

But before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.
He thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --

JON
Here.  I'll trade you.

-- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.
With a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but
he's already gone.

She stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.

82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY
JON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center
of the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S
TOOLS.

It's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the
central screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal
into its housing and gives it a light tap.

With a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love,
remember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed
with oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST
CHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of
it are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like
anti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.

He stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and
walks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK
from the direction of the test chamber.

Mounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,
seconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON
eyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to
the reinforced steel door of the chamber.

Inside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a
low platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it
hears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the
concrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.

JON
C'mon, little guy, outta here . . .

The mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in
hand.

JON (cont.)
. . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.

He stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch
inside.

He looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.
Agitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the
doorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of
the concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete
block, reaches for the watch --

-- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.

White-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete
block -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of
the support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.

Before his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --
TRAPPING HIM INSIDE.

He LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps
sliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams
shut.

83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT
1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One
of them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of
MILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the
facilities.

SCIENTIST
-- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the
intrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few
concrete blocks all to hell.

GENERAL
(joking, but worried)
No danger of . . . fallout, is there?

SCIENTIST
No sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why
we waited outside.

The translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a
dull red.

The crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant
THUMPING.

The SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect
unison.

GENERAL
What's the matter?

SCIENTIST
Sweet Jesus -- !

We DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of
the test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the
terrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,
screaming soundlessly.

Pandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,
punching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes
to a belated and painfully obvious realization:

GENERAL
Say, there's a man in there!!

The coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One
SCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --

SCIENTIST I
Stay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!

-- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:

SCIENTIST II
Building six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F.
chamber!!

The GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.

GENERAL
Well -- why doesn't someone let him out??

SCIENTIST III
It's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence
starts.
(to SCIENTIST II)
What's the word?

SCIENTIST II
(covering the phone)
They're sending a crew to the generator building --

SCIENTIST IV
TWENTY SECONDS!

In a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions ""IN
CASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.""  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the
canteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the
glass, and grabs the ax.

SCIENTIST I
Wally!  What are you doing?

WALLY
The power cables!!

And now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY
SLATER.

JANEY
Am I late for the --

She stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the
lab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back
through the door.

SCIENTIST III
Janey!  Get her out of here.  Get out!

But she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to
take a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils
have just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.

JANEY
What in the name of -- where's Jon?

SCIENTIST III
Janey!  Please!  Go!!

WALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a
sudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a
wall.

Sparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white
light.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look
at the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.

JANEY
Jon.

84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his
face.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,
which he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .
. .

. . . and everything in the room goes blue.

85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT
The SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to
tear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind
them.

JANEY
Jon . . .
(shrieking)
JON!!!

86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of
unbelievable agony.

A moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a
photographic negative -- stands in his place.

Then the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The
iridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to
pieces.

And then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,
and we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of
the SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,
who gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.

87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT
The desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall
behind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago
at 11:48 PM.

For a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches
the rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the
door of the canteen.

88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.

89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
TWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into
the mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous
thing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal
cord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous
system.

They pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in
a haze of shimmering blue light.

90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.

91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
HORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A
partially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS
for several seconds before vanishing altogether.

92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.

93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
Dinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.

JANEY
I can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it
feels haunted.

WALLY
It'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all.
(tugging at his ear)
Do you hear some kind of -- whistling?

Indeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.
Odder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's.
Everyone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish
phenomenon.

UTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without
warning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW
suffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .

. . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,
nude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and
utensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.

JANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go
to her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.

JANEY
JON-N-N-N!!!

DISSOLVE TO:

94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
THE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,
stares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and
begins to dig.

A couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient,
tattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and
Janey Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new
engagement ring.

His fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.

95. SERIES OF SHOTS
Quick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:

-- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;

-- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue
light;

-- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.
There's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a
terrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .

-- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom
cloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.

96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN
Fists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in
the ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at
first, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue
starburst a mile above the ground.

97. EXT. OUTER SPACE
All at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth
at unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on
toward Mars.

The red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame
as we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.
Individual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:
vast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.
Herschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre
planitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling
two jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular
ridge.

Two eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a
happy-face.

Many miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian
atmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we

Then there's a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same
positions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on
the White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.

99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT
A restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.
She's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the
big metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy
furnished studio.

TV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)

a crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania
Avenue!

TV ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
Well, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --

LAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later,
SCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.

All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.

LAURIE
Am I free to go?

SCHMIDT
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move
it.

I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit

Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan
border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living
soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic
weapons has finally flipped out.

LAURIE
Jon??  You mean he's --

SCHMIDT
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard
has apparently left the planet.

CUT TO:

100. EXT. NEWSTAND - DAY
The same headlines scream from every edition on the rack:

DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH
Russian Tanks Advance
President Vows ""Maximum Force""
WHERE IS DR. MANHATTAN?

And on the street, tensions are running high.  The familiar NEWS
VENDOR is engaged in a heated exchange with one of his CUSTOMERS:

NEWS VENDOR
I'll tell you what the problem is.  We shoulda been building tanks,
bombs, ICBM's!  Instead we been relying on that big blue son of a
bitch --

CUSTOMER
Anyone ever tell you you're full of shit?

NEWS VENDOR
Kiss my ass, buddy!  Keep your goddamn quarter!

VOICE
New Frontiersman, please.

The NEWS VENDOR turns suddenly, finds himself confronted by an old
friend: the red-haired STREET CRAZY with the end-of-the-world sign.
He rolls his eyes -- this is all I need -- and reaches under
the counter.

NEWS VENDOR
Here you go, pal.  Two bucks.
(beat)
Well, I see the world ain't ended yet.

The STREET CRAZY eyes the lurid cover of his magazine.  ""EXPOSED: RED
PLOT TO FRAME DR. MANHATTAN!""

STREET CRAZY
. . . How do you know?

CUT TO:

101. EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
A row of decayed walk-ups in a fringe neighborhood downtown.  A
DRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight
WOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and
off as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging
tipsy giggles.

102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT
A three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN
ushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY;
his is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed --
we'll call him MOLOCH.

MOLOCH
Now.  What was milady drinking?

LUCY
Gin.  Straight up --
(mock-ladylike)

-- with a little twist of lime.

She laughs convulsively, as if she's just told the world's funniest
joke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:

MOLOCH
I think I can oblige.

103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
MOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The
contents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen
floor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a
disaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in
the doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.

LUCY
Jeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?

On cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.
He grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen
table.

RORSCHACH
Moloch.  Did you miss me?

LUCY
Willie!  Jesus!  What's going on?

RORSCHACH
(glancing up)
Who's the welfare mother?

MOLOCH
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong
guy.

RORSCHACH
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.

MOLOCH
You're making a big --

RORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against
the table -- repeatedly, to the beat.

RORSCHACH
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.

MOLOCH
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?

LUCY
Willie, what's he talking about?

RORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor.
RORSCHACH kneels beside him.

MOLOCH
Look, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for
ten years.  I --

RORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him
close.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:

RORSCHACH
Turned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.
(twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look)
Hnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.

He shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar
bowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as
MOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Comedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's
behind it?

MOLOCH
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with
--

RORSCHACH
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.

MOLOCH
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --

RORSCHACH
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.

LUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as
RORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when
he stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Word of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.

-- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously
at MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking
about.

104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY
The familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a
big round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world
looming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a
MILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight
POINTER,
highlighting areas of strategic importance.

ANALYST
Our projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there
it's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.

GENERAL
Respectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They're
quizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.

MOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which
bears the seal of the President of the United States.

PRESIDENT
First strike.
(long pause)
I'd like to view the simulation.

The ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.

ANALYST
Optimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of
their retaliatory capability before they knew what hit 'em.

On the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the
Pacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf --
blossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION
SYMBOLS as they strike their targets.

PRESIDENT
What about our end?

ANALYST
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that
twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.

On the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.

ANALYST (cont.)
Britain down -- Germany down --

PRESIDENT
What kind of time frame are we talking about?

ANALYST
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified
command bunker at the time of the launch order.

RADIATION SYMBOLS sprout over New York, Baltimore, Washington,
Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

PRESIDENT
. . . Of course.

By now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a
dedicated optimist, turns to announce:

ANALYST
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the
farm belt.

PRESIDENT
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter""
theory?

ANALYST
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . .
may depend on a quirk of the weather.

PRESIDENT
The weather.  I see.
(pause)
Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum
strike conditions.

The SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G. Gordon Liddy -- pipes up:

SECRETARY LIDDY
Dick, before we act hastily, we should consider . . . Dr. Manhattan
may decide to return.

With a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the
table -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined
and tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he's none other than
that beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at
74.

PRESIDENT (cont.)
Good God.  At times like this I wish I'd never come out of
retirement.

105. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
A private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an
examination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the
doorway.

DOCTOR
I'm sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.

LAURIE
Not at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.

106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK
A greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near
the entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken
tandoori.

DREIBERG
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a
couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .
(pause)
How about you, Laurie?

LAURIE
(lying -- with forced cheer)
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the
hell out.
(shrugging)
No expense account.  No place to live.

DREIBERG
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each
other, someone might put two and two together . . .

LAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.

LAURIE
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're
right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the
Watchmen.

DREIBERG
Maybe not, but why take chances?

LAURIE
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent
all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel --
I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own
life, and --

-- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a
damper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts
to get up.

LAURIE
I'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find
myself a cheap room.

DREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the
door of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and
chases her down:

DREIBERG
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . .
.
LAURIE
Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --

DREIBERG
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely
right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.

LAURIE
You're sure?

He nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the
restaurant.

THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the
street outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of
frame, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of
ketchup.

He inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down
question mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he
opens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.

107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET
A SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,
then disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls
casually down the alleyway.

He moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the
crumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a
small recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a
shifting INKBLOT MASK.

108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:
flowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.
It's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative ""aah"" as
DREIBERG ushers her in.

LAURIE
This is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.

DREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands
there for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.

LAURIE (cont.)
Are you . . . waiting for a tip?

DREIBERG
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I
mean, if you need some aspirin, or --

LAURIE
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really
sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?

She gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her
unpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.

109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG
As he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE
unbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door
shut.

110. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
DREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds
his hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.

111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE
Another quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE --
LAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off
valiantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.

An oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into
frame; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP
overhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and
snatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.

112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG.
His head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom
adjacent.  He's going to be awake half the night thinking of
LAURIE.

113. EXT. STREET - DAY
Early morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in
an alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and
crewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.

MOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA
DINER.

114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
A twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and
pulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the
nose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges
of his EYELIDS.

His eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;
bizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it
up . . .

There's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.

A low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and
sees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.

He GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and
holds the stall door shut.

RORSCHACH
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational
drugs.

MOLOCH
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got
something for you.

A long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.

MOLOCH (cont.)
There's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on
a case, trying to track 'em down.
(beat)
It's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all
I've been able to find out.

RORSCHACH
Drug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh.
(snarling)
Let it go time.  In future -- just say no.

With that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits
there a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won't
open.

MOLOCH
HEY!!

RORSCHACH's stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the
adjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we

115. INT. VEIDT'S PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY
A plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it's
decorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in
an overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he's in the
process of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure
who's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.

JUSTINE
Now Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know.
Are you the world's smartest man?

VEIDT
Oh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.

A round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!

JUSTINE
You're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty
basic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday
lives.
(pause)
If you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?

VEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls
out his gold cigarette case.

VEIDT
Sphinx brand.
(opening the case)
When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . .
humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good
in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco,
that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs
as you smoke it?
(lighting up)
In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?

JUSTINE
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your
old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --

VEIDT
(bristling)
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the
Watchmen.

JUSTINE
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.

VEIDT
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --

VEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent.
He glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.

VEIDT (cont.)
-- we agreed specifically --

MORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting
curious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.

VEIDT (cont.)
Excuse me a second.

He goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley
JUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.

116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY
VEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with
his mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:

VEIDT
KITTY!!

One last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet --
no visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his
dignity.

VEIDT (cont.)
How the hell did you get in here?

The curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He
looks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass
window.

RORSCHACH
New information.

VEIDT
(pointing to the telephone)
Ever see one of these before?

RORSCHACH
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked
up.

VEIDT
What is that ungodly smell?

RORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark
HISS.

RORSCHACH
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .

VEIDT
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a
roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.
(beat)
And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us
all look bad.

RORSCHACH
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad
press.

He makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.

CUT TO:

117. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a
broiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and
cursing.

LAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full
glass of wine and thrusts it at him.

LAURIE
Daniel -- drink this.  Immediately.
(smiling)
I swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.

Sucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.

DREIBERG
Okay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think
of you as Dr. Manhattan's --

He catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.

LAURIE
His what?

DREIBERG
His . . . whatever.

LAURIE
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?

She spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward
the dining room.

LAURIE
Look, I just want to eat dinner and get drunk.  Let's not make it any
more difficult than we have to, huh?

A DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty
dishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in
dismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.

DREIBERG
Good Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball
game.

LAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much
interest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo
cabinet.

LAURIE
That's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game.
(smiling)
God!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.

She's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it
are row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's
items.

DREIBERG
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I
listen to -- it never came out on crystal.

LAURIE
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.
(flipping through records)
Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these
people.

DREIBERG
Play one.  Educate yourself.

LAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar
COMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and
gazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.

LAURIE
Oh look.  It's Adrian's ad.

TV CHORUS
""Oh my darling, it's incredible,
That someone so unforgettable . . .""

120. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT
MOLOCH's apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as
RORSCHACH lets himself in.

TV CHORUS
"". . . Should think I am unforgettable too.""

RORSCHACH
Moloch?

No reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera,
seemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance
around the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen,
the WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her
face:

TV ANNOUNCER
The years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and
wrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming
NOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses
the aging process . . .

Moloch?

He creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.

121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH
staring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND
BULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and
spins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --

TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
For the smooth young face he'll never forget --

122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the
TV ad.

TV ANNOUNCER
-- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.

DREIBERG
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?

LAURIE
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm
thirty-eight years old!

DREIBERG
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide
it?

LAURIE
I like the way you look.
(beat)
It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change.
But you, Daniel, you look . . .

DREIBERG
Old?

LAURIE
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.
(standing up)
Here, you pick one.

DREIBERG
. . . What?

LAURIE
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.

Her tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then,
with a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.

123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT
RORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:

LOUDSPEAKER
RORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO
COME OUT.

He goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street
outside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A
CTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.

LOUDSPEAKER
YOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!

He's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES
-- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.

124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller
tune, ""S'posin'.""  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces
illuminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile
she reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt
pocket.

Dreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making
him nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her
hands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so
that he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on
his mouth.

The PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:

""S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . .
Do you think that you could love me too . . .""

125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
SONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a
horrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying
a plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans --
ordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around
under the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid,
rubbing alcohol, Drano.

Almost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the
burners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.

""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . .
Would it impress you . . .""

126. INT. TENEMENT - FRONT STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
A contingent of ARMED CTU MEN rushing silently up the stairs.

""Or would it distress you?  Hmm?""

127. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
RORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and
rubbing alcohol.  There's a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied --
resting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the
front door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the
hallway just outside the living room.

The door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH
strikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --
creating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the
puddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF
BOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.

""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .
(Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.)
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . .""

128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in
disarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky,
unable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going
well.

""S'posin' I declare it
Would you take my love and share it?
I'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . .""

He wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her
breast.

129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through
the kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.

He empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he
ducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.

130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)
RORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper
into its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from
the smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov
cocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.

The COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit
the floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.

RORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is
coming up with back way behind him.

131. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)
Charred COPS, leaping FLAMES.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the GAS STOVE.

132. EXT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
A GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE
hails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:

""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you? . . .
Would it impress you? . . .""

133. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG's pants.  Finally he can't stand it
anymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and
sits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she
doesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side,
embracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.

"". . . Or would it distress you?""

134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
RORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level.
By now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU
COPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.

He still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for
his last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket,
where it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.

""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn . . .""

The COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He
steps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their
weapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.

The COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as
RORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.

135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
RORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the
face.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a
blimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN
FIRE peppers the roof.

""S'posin' I declare it.
Would you take my love and share it? . . .""

RORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE
ESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front
of the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on
the street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and
tries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed
AIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.

""I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you.""

The song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL
OF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street
below.

136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
Three stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and
lies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on
him instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle
butts.

COPS
GET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!

RORSCHACH
GNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!

In seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face
topped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar
face . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand
with his placards announcing the end of the world.

COP
Christ.  He's got five-inch heels.  The fuckin' runt wears
elevator shoes!

RORSCHACH
NO!!  NO!!  GIVE IT BACK!!

He kicks and claws at the COPS as they drag him unceremoniously off
to a nearby van.

COP II
So that's the terror of the underworld.  That ugly little zero.

RORSCHACH
GIVE ME BACK MY FACE!!!

The van doors slam shut on RORSCHACH -- just as the first FIRE TRUCKS
arrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement.

CUT TO:

137. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE stretched out on the sofa, under a blanket.  He
stares up at the ceiling, still troubled.

DREIBERG
I'm sorry, Laurie.  I --

LAURIE
It's all right, Dan.  I just want you to hold me, okay?  -- Just hold
me.

For a few moments she lies nestled peacefully against his chest.  His
gaze drifts over to the TV.  Suddenly he BLANCHES.

LAURIE
Daniel.  What --

On the TV screen is a huge bluescreen closeup of RORSCHACH.  DANIEL
reaches for the remote control to turn up the volume.

TV ANCHOR
. . . A ten-year manhunt ended tonight with the capture of the masked
vigilante known as Rorschach.  Eight CTU men died in the violent
confrontation at a downtown tenement . . .

The news report CUTS LIVE to the smoking wreckage of the tenement.

LAURIE
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.

DREIBERG
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get
to trial.

Now the screen shows side-by-side closeups of the inkblot mask and
the acne-scarred face beneath it.  LAURIE looks on, transfixed.

TV ANCHOR
. . . identified as Walter Joseph Kovacs, 44, a transient with a
history of psychological disorders.  A former landlord described
Kovacs as a self-confessed loner and political extremist:

LANDLORD (ON TV)
All kinda weirdo literature, paraphernalia . . . you shoulda seen that
place when I threw him out.  Talk about pigpens --

LAURIE hits the mute button, settles back and lets out a low
whistle.  DREIBERG, distracted, pours a glass of wine and gets up to
pace the room.

LAURIE
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.
(beat)
I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel?
What's wrong?

DREIBERG
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.

He stares at her, obviously wondering: who's next?

138. EXT. NEWS KIOSK - EVENING
The familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID
-- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement
nearby, reading a comic book.

The NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic
little number entitled ""COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS.""

NEWS VENDOR
Hey, this ain't a lending library.  I expect you to pay me for
that.

KID
No way.  This one sucks.

A CUSTOMER -- 50, black, on the tubby side -- stops at the
newsstand.  His name is DR. MALCOLM LONG.

DR. LONG
Gazette, please.

The NEWS VENDOR hands over a copy of the Gazette.  The cover
bears side-by-side photos of RORSCHACH and his alter ego, KOVACS,
with the banner headline: ""CTU APPREHENDS MASKED KILLER.""

NEWS VENDOR
'Dyou see this?  This guy's a customer of mine!
(shaking his head)
I mean, I always knew he was a little flaky, but -- wild, huh?  You
never know.

LONG hands over a quarter, unfolds the paper and begins to read as he
wanders off down the street.

139. STUDY - NIGHT
DR. LONG, who happens to be a police psychiatrist, sits at a big desk
with a vast heap of paperwork -- which includes a mug sheet of
RORSCHACH (minus the mask) and a neatly-typed arrest report from the
NYPD:

NAME: Kovacs, Walter Joseph
ADDRESS: Transient
BORN: 3/21/43
MOTHER'S NAME: Kovacs, Sylvia J. (nee Glick)
FATHER'S NAME: Unknown

By now LONG is working on his third pot of coffee.  His wife, SYLVIA,
wanders in behind him, dressed for bed in her robe and slippers.  When
she rests her hands on his shoulders, he nearly jumps out of his
seat.

DR. LONG
Oh!  Sorry.  I didn't hear you.

SYLVIA
How much longer?
(staring down at the desk)
It's that vigilante, isn't it.  That --

DR. LONG
Rorschach
(correcting himself)
Kovacs.  Incredible case.  Blinded two children at the age of ten.
We pulled his record from the juvenile home --

Without looking up he shoves a sheaf of papers in SYLVIA's
direction.

DR. LONG (cont.)
No father.  Mother a prostitute.  Some evidence of systematic child
abuse . . .
(swiveling to face her)
Classic case of misplaced aggression.  You know, these vigilantes,
these ""Watchmen"" -- there's never been a systematic study to find out
just what makes them do it.

SYLVIA
Malcolm, don't get too -- overwhelmed by all this.

SYLVIA picks up a blurry xerox of a child's drawing: TWO HIDEOUS
FIGURES, male and female, with wild eyes, fangs, and matted hair.
They're conjoined like Siamese twins at the mouth, belly, and
crotch.  This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title ""MY
DREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13.""

It's too strong to look at for long.  She sets it down with a
shiver.

SYLVIA (cont.)
Why don't you come to bed?

DR. LONG
(totally engrossed)
I'd like to get my hands on some of the others.  Explosive
material.
(grabbing a transcript)

Mother died when he was fourteen.  When they told him, he had one
word of comment: ""Good.""

SYLVIA shoots him a hard look, shakes her head almost imperceptibly,
and gives up.  She turns and pads silently out of the room.  LONG
goes right on talking, unaware that his audience has left.

DR. LONG (cont.)
Still, he's not stupid.  In some ways he's got an
extraordinary mind.  I think I can reach him.
(nodding his head)
I can reach him.

CUT TO:

140. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
A bare, windowless chamber, 10' by 10'.  LONG and RORSCHACH sit in
folding chairs on opposite sides of a square table.  The doctor
reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a stack of CARDS.

DR. LONG
Now, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look
at each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All
right?

RORSCHACH's face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.  DR. LONG turns up
the first card, a symmetrical inkblot, part of a Rorschach test.

RORSCHACH
Butterfly.

LONG nods, makes a notation on a pad, turns up the next card.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Some nice flowers.

LONG eyes him skeptically, makes another note, turns up the third
card.  RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
A doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.

He shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of
frustration.

DR. LONG
Walter --

RORSCHACH
Don't call me that.

DR. LONG
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to
hear.

RORSCHACH
Wrong answers?

DR. LONG
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest
response, I can't help you.
(pause)
I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.

RORSCHACH
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.

LONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this.
He shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under
the table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.

DR. LONG
Well, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide
to cooperate.

TWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to
leave.  He pauses in the doorway.

RORSCHACH
Doctor.  You don't want to help me.  You just want to find out what
makes me sick.
(beat)
You'll find out.  -- You'll find out.

CUT TO:

141. INT. VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY
A huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns,
fountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden.
JUSTINE's hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the
central escalator and swing into action.

JUSTINE
Adrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?

He's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and
secretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the
cameras.

VEIDT
No comment.

JUSTINE
Did you know he was back on the streets?

VEIDT
I did not.  Now get out of my way!

JUSTINE
Isn't it true that you --

He keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he
STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a
pillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.

ASSASSIN
VEIDT!

VEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and
comes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's
agility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY
in his hands.

He swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a
FOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.

As the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and
slams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King
Tut.

VEIDT
Son of a bitch.  Who sent you?

Arms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's
hair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.

SECURITY GUARD
Stand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!

VEIDT
He's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you
scum, I want to know who sent you!

The ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down
into the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.

VEIDT
Goddammit . . .

SECURITY GUARD
Who'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?

VEIDT
I don't know.  I don't know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.

CUT TO:

142. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK
TIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.

NEWSCASTER
-- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating
fears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside
St. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from
morning Mass --

A PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV,
reaches for the receiver.

DREIBERG
Yeah.
(beat)
Adrian!  What's up?

143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG
VEIDT
In have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it
on the news.
(beat)
Someone tried to kill me today.

For a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether
surprised.

DREIBERG
Who?

VEIDT
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm
starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?

DREIBERG
She's with me.

VEIDT
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.
(beat)
Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until
all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.

DREIBERG
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.

He hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box.
LAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off
her hair.

LAURIE
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?

DREIBERG
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.
(beat)
. . . First time I've ever heard him scared.

He doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks
up on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away
from him and steadies herself against a bureau.

DREIBERG
-- What is it.

LAURIE
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't
around.

DREIBERG
Laurie --

LAURIE
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --

DREIBERG
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.

His sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG,
fed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over
behind her.

LAURIE
I shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told
you --

But before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from
behind.

DREIBERG
Laurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than
anything else in the world.

CUT TO:

144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT
CONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving
area.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward
the dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby
tables:

VOICE
Hey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --

VOICE II
Rorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --

Low, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH
picks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The
smallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.

GOON I
Didn't know he was such a tiny little thing.

GOON II
Little?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.

RORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A
SERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.

GOON III
I'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. .
.

GOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.

GOON III (cont.)
Notched up some big names over the years.

Suddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of
his dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III
follows.

The others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving
counter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings
a KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and
tumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down,
into a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.

Landing on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH
uses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON
II lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby
burner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with
HOT COOKING FAT.

All this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two
disfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked
and smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in
with billy clubs drawn.

As the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It
sounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.

CUT TO:

145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT
A prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor --
delivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of
the cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are
totally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal
doors.

At a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door,
then throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of
RORSCHACH.

TRUSTY
Hey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin'
man.
(beat)
Their friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . .
this whole place blows.

RORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The
TRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.

TRUSTY (cont.)
I'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --

RORSCHACH
I'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.

With that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.

CUT TO:

146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
LONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a
square table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED
WIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.

Through a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across
the table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of
inkblots as before, the ""butterfly"" leading off.  But this time, the
subject has decided to cooperate:

RORSCHACH
A whore fucking.

DR. LONG
Who is she?  Do you know her?

Too obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the ""nice
flowers"":

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Man's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.

LONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Doggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog --
(pause; then, smiling)
-- with his skull split open.

DR. LONG
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?

RORSCHACH
Why, doctor.  I did.
(beat)
He was a bad dog.

RORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass
tacks.

DR. LONG
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In
your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?

RORSCHACH
God isn't there to do it.

DR. LONG
We don't know that.

RORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.

DR. LONG
So the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it?
(no response)
You tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why
would you want to kill a dog?

With LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:

RORSCHACH
One night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.

147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
Ruined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for
the distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues
OVER SCENE:

RORSCHACH (V.O.)
'75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no
word.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to
intervene.

The lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up
his collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a
ramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Got a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.

He peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO
HUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen
object.

148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
A DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,
flicks on a flashlight.

Mannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The
light shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders
over.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and
on the floor, a ROPE.

There's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,
sticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a
charred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with
balloons and teddy bears.

He stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden
CHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding
paraphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's
knives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh
WINDOW.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Dogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had
gone.

149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
The German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the
dogs until we see what it is they're tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB
OF BONE.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Decided to wait for the owner . . .

150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Keys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN
enters and whistles to the dogs.

FAT MAN
Fred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--

RORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.

151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
RORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the
story.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his
reply, asks:

DR. LONG
Then what happened?

RORSCHACH
. . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had
to break in.

152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
The FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's
handcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a
GROCERY SACK.

He kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off
his glove and reaches into the sack.

FAT MAN
What -- what are you d--

RORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER
into his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he
spends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face,
throat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's
done, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER
BLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.

FRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,
and -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs
inside.

Then he stands back and enjoys the carnage.

153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
DR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things
up.

RORSCHACH
When they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their
skulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.
(leaning forward)
See, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed
her . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,
he did't seem to mind.

DR. LONG
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --

RORSCHACH
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make
it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.
(slight smile)
What else can I illuminate?

LONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the
PRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he
points a finger at LONG's inkblot.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
No right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .
just a man's face.
(pause)
See it now?

The GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a
couple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a
second he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he
STOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern
on top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.

LONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the
Rorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.

DISSOLVE TO:

154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK
A rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls
up outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to
the padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.

After a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.

LAURIE
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?

DREIBERG
Memory lane.

He opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.

155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER
Inside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.

LAURIE
Daniel . . .

DREIBERG
Gimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.

She goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull
it back to reveal . . .

THE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit
tarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight.
DREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around
to join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.

LAURIE
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.

DREIBERG
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.

156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on
the electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,
reliving days gone by.

LAURIE
Wow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?

DREIBERG
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some
cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.

LAURIE
Antarctica??

DREIBERG
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come
along.
(pause)
I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a
bad place to sit out a war.

LAURIE
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be
left.

DREIBERG
You and me.

He looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her
gaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the
cabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly
rejected.

DREIBERG
. . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there
anyway.

Behind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just
opened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES
-- their old superhero togs.

LAURIE
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.

DREIBERG
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.
(chuckling)
The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping
people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't
know.  It all seems so abstract.

LAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing
herself in a small mirror above a sink.

LAURIE
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.

DREIBERG
What are you up to?

LAURIE
Don't look.  Turn around.

Smirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the
cabin.

DREIBERG
This'd better not be what I think it is.

LAURIE
Okay!

DREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite
imposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns
shock:

DREIBERG (cont.)
My God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender
of the weak!

LAURIE
In the flesh.

She ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,
and strokes his thinning hair.

LAURIE (cont.)
Poor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.

DREIBERG
Saving the world?  I guess I do.
(smiling)
Maybe we can still save ourselves . . .

DISSOLVE TO:

157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK
A massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned
out; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met
by CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous
BOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and
hawks, they're all frightened as hell.

Things are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow.
The end is nigh, and passions flare.  It's anarchy waiting to
happen.

MAN ON STAGE
You know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They're
sitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That's right --
a first strike!

VOICE IN CROWD
You think the reds ain't doing the same thing?

MAN ON STAGE
Then for the love of God let's negotiate.  We can start a war.  But
we can't stop it!!

VOICE IN CROWD II
It's pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!

VOICE IN CROWD III
Dr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!

VOICE IN CROWD IV
It's God's judgment!  Jesus is the way!

A HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:

HECKLER
Russia's just been waiting for an opening.  They won't show us
no mercy.  I say NUKE 'EM NOW!!

MAN ON STAGE
You think this is some kind of grudge match??  We're talking the
end of the world!!

The two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the
stage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start
swinging rifle butts.

As PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of
HOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides --
outfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials
""CTU""

158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
CTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.

CTU CAPTAIN
I've had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.

159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
PANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their
midst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.

LOUDSPEAKER
CEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.

A couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles,
turn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling
rocks, brickbats -- whatever's handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.

CUT TO:

160. INT. BARN - DUSK
DREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT,
wiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:

DREIBERG
Guess that ought to do it.  Let's shut her down --  Laurie?

No reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.

161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
LAURIE's standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her
face is distraught, agonized.

LAURIE
Daniel, you ought to take a look at this.

Onscreen, it's total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the
CTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs
below.

DREIBERG
What the hell -- ?

LAURIE
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.

DREIBERG
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.

He turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.

LAURIE
They're just mowing 'em down.
(pause)
This is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG's stricken face as we

CUT TO:

162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE>
We're back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE
OWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame,
like the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws
closer, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out
NIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.

There's a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless
motions stylized and surreal.  They're beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as
the Owlship's powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy
equivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --

-- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE
TRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the
action QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in
full-color and real-time --

163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
-- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the
Watchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St.
Seaport!

164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.

DREIBERG
Okay Laurie, let's see if we've still got what it takes.

On the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.

165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT
A RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.

CTU RADAR MAN
Sir, we've got an odd blip off starboard . . .

The ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --

166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT
-- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured
ship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets
sputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against
the water.

167. ANGLE ON CROWD
pointing at the skies in disbelief.

VOICE IN CROWD
LOOK!  UP THERE!

VOICE IN CROWD II
Oh my God, it's --


168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG
He barks into a microphone:

DREIBERG
Attention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --

169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
Ground level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the
OWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:

OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER
-- or we'll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!

CTU LOUDSPEAKER
UNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.

OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER
BABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.

The crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But
a dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the
strange sight overhead.

VOICE IN CROWD
. . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!

EXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,
clumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging
immobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West
showdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
into position.

170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.

DREIBERG
We're gonna have to shave this one close.

An instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle
FULL-FORWARD.

171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
With a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS
CONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond
before -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES
FORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD
CHEERS.

172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
DREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the
aft view from the ship.

LAURIE
They're following us.

DREIBERG
All right.  Mission accomplished.

He's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the
ship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.

173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU
SHIPS rip past on either side.

174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT
ASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The
OWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE
blows a HOLE in its facade.

175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
firing TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.

176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar
readout:

LAURIE
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!

DREIBERG
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.

LAURIE
(checking the monitor)
They're practically on us . . .

DREIBERG
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.

He punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled ""TURBO.""

177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP
The turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving
the CTU craft in the dust.

178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT
A line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,
and -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.

A moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The
less-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and
EXPLODES

The SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last
moment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP
ITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles
for the airborne route.

179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER
The OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the
cars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.

There's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges
UP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS
against the roof of the tunnel.

180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The end of the tunnel is coming up fast.

DREIBERG
Fog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.

181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an
almost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its
wake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --
but, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward
on a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the
water.

182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
They're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of
intense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.

LAURIE
We lost him.

He flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she
shakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.

LAURIE (cont.)
Oh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.

FADE THROUGH TO:

183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT
The usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving
line.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall
and falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of
him.

TRUSTY
Just left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.

The CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes
through the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,
it's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named
T-BONE.

CON IN LINE
Otis went down.

T-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of
SIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the
biggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:
LITTLE BIGGER.

T-BONE
Just heard, boss.  Otis bought it.

LITTLE BIGGER
Fuckin' Rorschach.
(nodding to himself)
This joint goes up.  Tonight.

184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT
Drifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship
emerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale
blue moonlight.

185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
Through the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then
disappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour
of the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is
singing ""You're My Thrill.""

Instruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the
controls.

The ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the
width of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it
right.

It's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.
The pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the
cabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.

LAURIE
Better.  Much better.

DREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile
instead.

LAURIE (cont.)
I bet I know what made the difference this time.

DREIBERG
What?

LAURIE
(smirking)
The costumes.  Am I right?

DREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite
himself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.

LAURIE (cont.)
Come on.  Admit it!

DREIBERG
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.

LAURIE
Yes you are.

DREIBERG
(drily)
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.
(pause; then, seriously)
Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.

LAURIE
That's because --

DREIBERG
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's
about to end.
(a weird smile)
I feel like I could save it.

He grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to
the instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship
hard right.

LAURIE
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?

DREIBERG
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .
(turning to face her)
I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.

LAURIE
. . . What??

DREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches
for the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.

186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
AFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through
the clouds above the city.

CUT TO:

187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON
-- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL
as we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:
disabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,
throwing food.

188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are
riveted to a monitor over the controls:

DREIBERG
I think we're just a trifle late.

LAURIE
Jesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .

The MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below
them.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire
with the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.

DREIBERG
I know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen
times.

189. INT. CELL - NIGHT
SIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs
drawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.

190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT
Smoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past
sprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR
MENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the
psychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,
and T-BONE.

Wheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop
outside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.

LITTLE BIGGER
Find an outlet for this thing
(shouting)
Rorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!

RAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying
a big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's
door, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.

CARLOS
See this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . .
and pickle 'em!!
(chortling)
Aww!  I think he just wet his pants!

HILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place
at the panel in the door:

T-BONE
Lemme see.  Lemme see!

LITTLE BIGGER
Relax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.
(to T-BONE)
What's he doin' now?

No response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed
tightly to the panel.

LITTLE BIGGER (cont.)
You deaf?  I said, what's he --

He gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over
backwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON
quivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye
socket.

RAFE
BOSS!  JESUS!

LITTLE BIGGER
Son of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE
A GRAPE.
(to RAFE)
Light the torch.

RAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of
RORSCHACH's cage.

191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT
RORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the
inside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.

CUT TO:

192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic
EARMUFFS.

DREIBERG
Okay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof
running . . .

He throws a switch on the control panel.

193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
WINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH
splits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop
their weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as
the Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .

194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT
The LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S
FACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the
wall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his
TOILET.

Grunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its
mounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is
FLOODED.

195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER
RAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.

RAFE
Okay, boss, that oughta do it.

They give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER
come gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.

LITTLE BIGGER
WHAT THE --

RAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but
there's no trace of RORSCHACH.

CARLOS
Rorschach.  Company's calling . . .

RAFE
Where is the fuckin' runt?

CARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his
fist.

196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT
In answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.
He SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of
the LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .

. . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,
monkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide
and an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.

CARLOS
YOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --

From the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor
BETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --

-- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --

-- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do
a herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --

-- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock
DIM and DIE.

LITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down
off his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies
of the dead.

RORSCHACH
Your move . . . runt.

The midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor
as fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.

197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER
DREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to
get their bearings.

LAURIE
Where are we?  What happened to the lights?

DREIBERG
Generators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary .
. .

Their heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND
CORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a
SCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.

DREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a
familiar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.

DREIBERG
. . . Rorschach??

RORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second
and a half -- then keeps on walking.

198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER
The terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He
throws a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.
Desperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.

RORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,
LAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross
corridor.

LAURIE
Rorschach!  Is that you??

He turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and
dispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand
at the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.

LAURIE
What's he doing?

DREIBERG
I think he's going to the john.

LAURIE
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and
he stops to take a --

Before she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a
paper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a
""howdy.""

DREIBERG
. . . That was quick.

RORSCHACH
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.
(beat)
Let's get out of here.

CUT TO:

199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT
A well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky
Mountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.

Air Force One is coming in for a landing.

200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER
Lots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling
about.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.

SECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and
what looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal
ramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an
imposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating
a long stay.

PRESIDENT NIXON
Hello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?

SECRETARY LIDDY
She's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right
away.

LIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless
corridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.

SECRETARY LIDDY (cont.)
Weatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour
window.

PRESIDENT NIXON
Fourteen hours, huh?

SECRETARY LIDDY
Fourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.

CUT TO:

201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
LAURIE's following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen
. . .

NEWSCASTER
-- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place
the one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --

. . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control
console, occupied by other matters.

DREIBERG
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his
mangy cat on me.

DREIBERG
What new information?

RORSCHACH
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan
somehow involved . . .
(scratching his chin)

Strange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.

There's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG,
highly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.

DREIBERG
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.

LAURIE
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?

Still grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at
the monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the
screen:

NEWSCASTER
. . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was
unavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the
Antarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.

RORSCHACH
""Ozone layer""?

DREIBERG
(rolling his eyes)
Christ.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??

CUT TO:

202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT
The last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of
pristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous
strip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered
around what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is
one.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.

203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT
The entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian
style as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad
figure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered
LYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.
One of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a
silver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back
of the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.

LACKEY
Welcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.

VEIDT
Feed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.

They hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him
to:

204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT
The room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated
REMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,
RED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.

VEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal
a towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,
picking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more
informational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,
a hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in
and his eyes begin to rove.

205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL
PANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,
sitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled ""LONDON.""
VEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
comes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense
logo . . .

BBC NEWSCASTER
-- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as
possible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter
can be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --

FLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to
the right, to the monitor labelled ""WASHINGTON D.C.""  Sound up:

NEWSCASTER
-- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have
already been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen
insist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing
negotiations --

FLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the
bottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic
retreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new
angle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are
clear.  FLICK --

-- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're
watching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from
twenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas
canteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to
propose.

206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT
eyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.

CUT TO:

207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
LOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds.
On its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.

208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of
the city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS,
gradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off,
POLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.

DREIBERG
They've got my building surrounded.
(looking up at her)
They must've been following you all along.

She stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the
accelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.

DREIBERG (cont.)
So much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.

LAURIE
Welcome back, Night Owl.

DREIBERG
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?

RORSCHACH
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.

DREIBERG
What do you mean, frame-up?

RORSCHACH
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --

DREIBERG
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to
get back at us?
(spreading his hands)
What about all those poor shits with cancer?

TIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting
distress.

RORSCHACH
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive
propaganda scheme . . .

DREIBERG
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --

LAURIE
(interrupting him)
It's not.

RORSCHACH
Not what?

LAURIE
Not ""propaganda.""
(pause; then, blurting it out --)
Christ, I'm one of them!  I've got it.

DREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face
bone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her
grim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can
think of anything to say.

Then RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the ""case,"" breaks the
silence.

RORSCHACH
Hnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.

209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
RORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he
pries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily
at a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers
above.

210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.

LAURIE
I should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between
us to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --

DREIBERG
It doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.

He tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up
with tears.

LAURIE
I love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get
myself together, okay?

211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.
RORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of
satisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees
DREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.

Above their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.

212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona
resolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.

LAURIE
Jon.  What are you doing here?

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.

LAURIE
Collect me?

DR. MANHATTAN
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye.
You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .

LAURIE
Jon, no -- I can't --

DR. MANHATTAN
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us
can do anything to change it.

DREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside
the cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.
MANHATTAN's hand.

DREIBERG
LAURIE!  DON'T --

Hands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and
LAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.

Stunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can
do.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.

RORSCHACH
Where's Laurie?

DREIBERG
I don't think she's coming with us.

DISSOLVE TO:

213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT
A BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian
surface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later
LAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps,
then GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red
sands.

DR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a
problem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at
the air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back
and extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by
a HALO OF OXYGEN.

DR. MANHATTAN
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.

LAURIE
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --

Ignoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she
stops in her tracks.

Before her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a
PALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren
sands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,
surrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and
pendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering
crystalline castle.

DR. MANHATTAN
I live here now.

He strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after
him.

CUT TO:

214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
TIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the
glow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.

RORSCHACH
Heading south.  What's the plan?

DREIBERG
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're
hightailing it down to Adrian's.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --

DREIBERG
(exploding)
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to
end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't
matter.

RORSCHACH
Coward.  Giving up.

DREIBERG
SHUT UP, Rorschach.

RORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.

RORSCHACH
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.
(pause)
Sorry about Laurie.

DREIBERG
(choked voice)
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.

For a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well
enough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.

CUT TO:

215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT
LAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals
around the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the
enormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING
-- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.

LAURIE
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me
you're sleeping with Dreiberg.

LAURIE
You -- you know about me and Dan?

He gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.

DR. MANHATTAN
Time is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll
finally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.

LAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.

LAURIE
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?
(flustered)
Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks
at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of
atoms.

DR. MANHATTAN
(startled)
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?

LAURIE
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.

DR. MANHATTAN
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even
my responses.
(nodding)
We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  --
Thirty seconds.

She GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle
of the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles
below them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent
WIND whips across their faces.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way
out toward the edge of the universe.
(staring out at the landscape)
Utterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?

She moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and
fissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and
frightened.

LAURIE
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me
once?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.

LAURIE
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be
being with me.

DR. MANHATTAN
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't
know what did.

LAURIE
But you knew that I'd -- die.

DR. MANHATTAN
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to
dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .
(pause)
You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.

LAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.

LAURIE
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've
always known.

DR. MANHATTAN
(nodding)
Always.  Ever since the day I died.

He walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the
forbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in
her hands.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
Do you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me
these last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be
destroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless
agent of its destruction?

LAURIE
(sobbing)
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!

DR. MANHATTAN
Because --

LAURIE
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.
(angrily)
Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six
hundred years.

That about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the
shoulders:

LAURIE
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to
die I want to be with -- other people.

DR. MANHATTAN
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a
universe to explore.  I'll be alone.
(reaching for her hand)
You're the last human being I'll ever see.

CUT TO:

216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south
Atlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and
begins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .

217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro.
Finally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad
tumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:

RORSCHACH
What happened?

DREIBERG
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some
kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.

RORSCHACH
What caused it?

DREIBERG
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --
(apprehensively)
-- outside of a nuclear blast.

DISSOLVE TO:

218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT
VEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible
through a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.

219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
VEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled ³MOSCOW² and ³WASHINGTON, D.C.² -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.

A second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.

220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.

221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
Through the cockpit, KARNAK¹s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it¹s lost in the snows again.

DREIBERG
I¹m taking her down.
(frantically throwing switches)
Radar¹s blown.  I¹ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --

The SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.

222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.

A HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They¹re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.

223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
VEIDT¹s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.

As he watches, the screens for ³LONDON² and ³PARIS² go WHITE.

224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER
DREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN¹S VOICE announces:

VOICE
Welcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.

DREIBERG
Adrian!  It¹s Dreiberg.  For God¹s sake open the doors.

Nothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.

DREIBERG (cont.)
Adrian!  We¹re freezing to death out here!

He slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.

RORSCHACH
. . . He¹s not coming, Daniel.

225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
On the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.

The wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, ³PRAGUE² goes white.

226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT
DREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.

DREIBERG
Can¹t move . . . we¹re done for.

RORSCHACH
Come on.  Found an exhaust vent.

RORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Veidt.  It¹s been Veidt all along.  He¹ll pay for this.

227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT
VEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.

TWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.

VEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX
growls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's
neck: quiet, girl.

RORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN
FLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening
scene.  Suddenly . . .

RORSCHACH
VEIDT!

VEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;
it catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG
backs against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward
him, TEETH BARED.

VEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a
futuristic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --
part of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.

DREIBERG
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?

RORSCHACH
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.

DREIBERG
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --

VEIDT
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of
course . . .

DREIBERG
The missing scientists.

VEIDT
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked
at Gila Flats.

RORSCHACH
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .

VEIDT
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save
the world.

228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
Gun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.
RORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping
at his heels.

VEIDT
Blake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers
-- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia.
(tapping his chest)
It was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill
him.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my ""assassination"" --
that was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting
rid of Dr. Manhattan.

DREIBERG
What??

VEIDT
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.

RORSCHACH
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.

VEIDT
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.
(smiling)
He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a
little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates
cancer.

DREIBERG
Laurie?  You're responsible for --

VEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls
out a smoke and strikes it against the box.

VEIDT (cont.)
One thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate
than it is to cure.

DREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the
stun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and
LEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.

VEIDT
Let's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you
without a moment's thought.

They've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200
SCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them
inside.

RORSCHACH
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.

VEIDT
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking
at.

229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
VEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand
corner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila
Flats, reassembling a WATCH.

DREIBERG
What is this?  It looks like Jon.

VEIDT
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.
Manhattan.

DREIBERG
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?

VEIDT
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.

CUT TO:

230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,
LAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's
hit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On
Mars.

DR. MANHATTAN
I almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a
mystery I'd like to penetrate.

LAURIE
Jon, I do not want to hear it.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .

LAURIE
(shaking her head)
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.

DR. MANHATTAN
You're the only human being I care for.

LAURIE
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter
a bit.
(pause)
I want you to cure me.

DR. MANHATTAN
I won't do that.

LAURIE
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.

DR. MANHATTAN
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.

LAURIE
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you
-- then do it.

Eyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her
chest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.

Her fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.
MANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the
hardest decision of his life.  And then . . .

A BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN
INTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian
landscape altogether.

With a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see
the figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great
white VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the
Martian desert gradually materialize around them.

The two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like
statues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.

LAURIE
What -- am I --

DR. MANHATTAN
Cured, yes.

Utterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a
handrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart
attack.

LAURIE
Jon, what is it?  What's the matter?

When he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with
DREAD.

DR. MANHATTAN
Something. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on
me.  -- I can't remember the future.

Slowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around
him.

LAURIE
Jon.  Let's go back to Earth.

CUT TO:

231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT
VEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.
room at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring
machinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.

Inside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON
OSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into
its brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching
him from twenty-four years in the future.

VEIDT
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.
(pause)
Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.

DREIBERG
What is it?  How does it work?

VEIDT
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow
backward in time.
(smiling)
There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing
parallel to our own --

DREIBERG
Adrian -- you've lost it.

VEIDT
(pointing at the tachyon bubble)
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there.
(pause)

In some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it
survives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.

He draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.

VEIDT (cont.)
The creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.
(wild-eyed)
Do you understand now?  Do you see what I¹m going to do?  I¹m going to change the past!

232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT
DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.

LAURIE
We¹re too late.

DR. MANHATTAN
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .

LAURIE
Jon -- what??

DR. MANHATTAN
The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.

233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
Inside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY¹s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.

VEIDT
At first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.

He steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.

VEIDT
It ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.
(turning to face them)
In a minute I¹ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I¹ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman¹s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.

DREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.

RORSCHACH
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.

DREIBERG
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.

VEIDT
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?

DREIBERG
And what if you¹re wrong?

VEIDT
I¹m not.

DREIBERG
What if you¹re wrong??

VEIDT
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!
(shouting)
I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!

234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.

DR. MANHATTAN
That¹s it.  That¹s the source of the time disturbance.

LAURIE
Jon, where are we?

DR. MANHATTAN
Veidt¹s complex.

235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT

Twenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler¹s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:

VEIDT
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years
chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .
as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.

DREIBERG
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist
bullshit is going to save the world?

VEIDT
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.

He kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.
Then he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.

236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS
In the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears
a SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .

237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
A LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon
bubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up
--  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the
trigger . . .

. . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.
VEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .

. . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with
LAURIE at his side.

DR. MANHATTAN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?

VEIDT
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.

DR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees
himself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of
the I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's
surprised.

In the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to
sidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN
THE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.

VEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He
shoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and
points his STUN GUN directly at her --

-- and a millisecond later, he¹s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.

VEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN¹s outstretched finger --

VEIDT
NO!!!!

-- and in the wink of an eye, he¹s VAPORIZED.  All that¹s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.

DREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.

LAURIE
What was he doing?

DREIBERG
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --

DR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.

DR. MANHATTAN
He was right.

RORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.

DR. MANHATTAN
He did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It¹s so elegant.  It¹s so obvious.

DR. MANHATTAN¹s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.

LAURIE
Jon --

DR. MANHATTAN
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.

LAURIE
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?

DR. MANHATTAN
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!

He lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz
around his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the
room dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the
world into his own massive frame.

DR. MANHATTAN
My work here is finished . . .

The others cower.  They sense that something large is about to
happen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the
test chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the
tiny
hole in time.

He does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS
into a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND
STEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.

238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter
bewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling
gloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.

DR. MANHATTAN
Don't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.

A second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps
forward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.

For a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame
surrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.
MANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the
chamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across
the shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he
spreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding
FLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging
with nothingness . . .

. . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue
light dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's
alive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.

239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER
The timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of
his awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation
panel.

SCIENTIST
What in the name of God . . .

The SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,
sobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As
she clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he
looks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .

JON
Your watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --

SCIENTIST II
LOOK!!

The SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .
. . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular
RUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are
three odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and
RORSCHACH.

240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT
DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the
astounded SCIENTISTS.

LAURIE
What happened -- ?

DREIBERG
He saved himself.  He changed the past.

LAURIE
Where did he go?

Before DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to
THROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For
a moment everything's back to normal --

-- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to
DISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.

A sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around
them, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge
into . . .

241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT
DREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an
otherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time
could be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this
would be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate;
their tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they
know it, they find themselves deposited --

242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT
-- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them
materialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them,
slamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the
same, knocking over a fire hydrant.

LAURIE
Dan, is this -- is this New York??

DREIBERG
Those cars.  What year is this??

LAURIE
Everything's changed --

It's a disorienting world they've landed in.  In fact, it's
our world, our New York, and everything -- the cars,
the clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of
whack . . .

RORSCHACH
Hnrrrrr -- we never happened.

BYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the
obvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of
course, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden
presence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers:
Nuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?

RORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too
close, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to
several dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection
altogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a
shrill WHISTLE.

DREIBERG
Oh my God, they still ride around on horses!

243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT
The same newsstand we've seen all along -- but luckily, here in our
world, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: ""RUSSIAN SUMMIT
TALKS COLLAPSE.""  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR
is gapin at the ruckus on the street.

NEWS VENDOR
Jesus Christ, it must be Halloween.

His sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to
the befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.

KID
Shit, man!  It's Rorschach!  And Night Owl!

NEWS VENDOR
What are you talkin' about?

KID
Superheroes!  Check it out!

He thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR's hand and races off to
join the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares
down at the costumed characters in the comic book -- ""WATCHMEN"" --
then throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the
street.

KID
All right!  They must be on a case.

244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
HORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed
with curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived
to clear the streets and restore order.

COP I
Break it up!  Stand back!

COP II
Come on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --

DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle.
They don't know what to expect and they're poised for a brawl.  The
taunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant
to advance.

LAURIE
Dan -- what do we do now?

DREIBERG
(panicked)
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --

LAURIE
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't
they -- ?

RORSCHACH
They'd better.

And on RORSCHACH's final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and

FADE OUT.

THE END","FADE IN:  1. EXT. NEW YORK - LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY The STATUE OF LIBERTY stands watch at the mouth of the Hudson.  Over scene, we SUPER TITLE:  NEW YORK CITY - JULY 1976  2. JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY A live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the edge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind her.  CINDY -- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just agreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of freeing the hostages. (adjusting her hair) We repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some forty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers -- captive in the Statue of Liberty itself.  3. FERRYBOAT - DAY The ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island -- has been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN, who's in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via walkie-talkie. SWAT CAPTAIN Your demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their way.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you'll see the copters preparing for takeoff.  4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT The screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from Laguardia.  We're in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue's head. A TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women, schoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand by the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and a fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.  RINGLEADER Good.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and we blow her brains out.  SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.) (filter; from walkie-talkie) Blow whose brains out?  5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT TIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the jutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in the whole of the statue's head. RINGLEADER (O.S.) (a nasty laugh) Lady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!  6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY MOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.  SWAT COP Sons of bitches.  SWAT CAPTAIN Relax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out first.  SWAT COP II Captain . . . what the hell is that?  All eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from the clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head of the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:  SWAT CAPTAIN Shit.  Shit fire!!  SWAT COP Sir!  What is it? 7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS A magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic, blimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.  SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.) Christ almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!  8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT In the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold suited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting inkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.  NIGHT OWL Okay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?  He looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT, blond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:  VEIDT (on monitor) Let's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.  9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY A line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a thud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.  10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT TERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows nothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his walkie-talkie:  RINGLEADER Hey.  We got a problem here --  He releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.  RINGLEADER Come in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us, Goddammit !  11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT The SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared, he glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic frenzy.  SWAT COP Ignorant bastards!  They've jammed us!  SWAT COP II What do we do now?  SWAT CAPTAIN We sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.  12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY A HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water. There's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he swaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to reveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.  Superhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather breastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it matches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.  13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY A TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of the statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is fumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone haywire.  TERRORIST I Base to head.  Base to head.  Come in! (flustered) I can't get shit!  TERRORIST II What the hell is going on??  There's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison -- just as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.  Panic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of a long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to his head.  TERRORIST I I'M NOT JOKING!!  The COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED SHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice and he slumps to the floor, stone dead.  The TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too stunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --  COMEDIAN The joke's on you.  -- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As the saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.  14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor of the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --  15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY A sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to the nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL FIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.  While the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point behind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS and RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the statue's upraised TORCH.  The TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the far side of the torch.  RINGLEADER I don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.  16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.  RORSCHACH Got your flashgun?  CAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and goes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits behind.  17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY The COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout. He spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor, then strolls over and jimmies it open.  ANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different. This one's a WOMAN.  SILK SPECTRE About time.  It stinks down there.  COMEDIAN B-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.  As the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched wetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME underneath.  SILK SPECTRE Why do I get all the glamour jobs?  COMEDIAN A woman's work is never done.  18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY The TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later, CAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their guns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a TEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.  RINGLEADER I don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.  CAPT. METROPOLIS Please.  There's something I'd like you to see first.  He holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash. All at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding light has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the floor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.  All except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses. He pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.  19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER An edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed from behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at his throat.  COMEDIAN Okay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?  20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY Everyone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the TERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.  CAPT. METROPOLIS Don't cry, little one.  You're in good hands. (standing; to the crowd) Now everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.  He goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the torch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.  21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER A METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH secures it to the tip of the torch.  22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT SILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.  SILK SPECTRE Should be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .  COMEDIAN Just barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their balls off.  They look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead landing.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist hits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the landing.  23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER Gas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits in a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with UNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the COMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:  COMEDIAN Well.  They look distracted. (turning to face her) Don't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?  SILK SPECTRE Eddie -- !  Suddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He turns.  One of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself over to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A SWITCH on the housing.  A TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.  COMEDIAN SHIT!  He hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to blink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An empty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.  SILK SPECTRE What about the --  COMEDIAN FUCK 'EM!  There's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it around the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only a second before following suit.  24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER CAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once, he FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as well.  25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT YET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel. He looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.  NIGHT OWL Adrian!  VEIDT Yeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.  NIGHT OWL Well, good God, we can't just --  VEIDT Mission aborted, Daniel!  NIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.  26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT On the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.  27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS throwing off sparks against the cable.  28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER CAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands pressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and RORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off the torch.  29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT THE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE touches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator doors open, and the two of them dive through.  30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER RORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP streaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure of Lady Liberty.  Three beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.  31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT A heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an overhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.  32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER Smoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat against a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling DEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.  33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER The furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of the statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He turns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.  SWAT CAPTAIN That's it.  I quit.  The water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --  34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY -- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through the harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the demolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes wondering what the hell happened to his date.  Meet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR. MANHATTAN.  Down below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact -- are crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge blue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:  COMEDIAN ASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?  CUT TO:  35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT The Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.  SHEILA In the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has revoked its contract with Adrian Veidt's super-team.  Local police have threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the Watchmen are dropped.  On the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars surround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.  JIM And in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which would ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage is expected. (shuffling his papers) Well, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially history.  DISSOLVE TO:  36.  CREDITS SEQUENCE TIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather clocks, travel alarms, all perfectly synchronized -- DRIFT UPWARD through a vast black void, ticking off the seconds.  At the stroke of midnight, GONGS sound, BUZZERS buzz, BELLS tinkle -- and without warning the clocks EXPLODE.  As gears and coils and crystals cascade downward through the void, we SUPER TITLE:  WATCHMEN  FADE THROUGH TO:  37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT Darkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT UP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP drifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo faint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where heavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED PLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:  NEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER  38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by the garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the high-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated bubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on their roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.  A CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: ""NEW SKIRMISH ON AFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.""  CUSTOMER Crazy reds don't know who they're messing with. (indicating the cop cars) What happened over there?  NEWS VENDOR Some guy went sidewalk divin'  Twenny-five cents.  39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT A riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from the DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.  PATROLMAN STAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!  We are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of reality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the city -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance: his standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his plastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears a path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the back of a waiting ambulance.  DET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and buttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the investigation.  BURNS Had a lot of blood in him.  HYDE You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.  BURNS No idea who's behind this?  HYDE Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.  BURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.  BURNS He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.  HYDE Washington?  BURNS They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.  HYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after the ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.  40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT  TIGHT ON a large placard: ""THE END IS NIGH.""  The bearer of the sign, a hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk spreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make out an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.  The NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his collar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against the kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick, cross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in response and plugs on.  At the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the sidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET CRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain grate.  It's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its surface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to midnight.  The STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the shattered window some forty stories above.  DISSOLVE TO:  41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT CAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted corridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading ""POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.""  At the far end is a single door, SEALED OFF.  42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT MOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and overturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture window.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are flapping wildly.  A ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.  SHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps inside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is invisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the room.  The apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints, gaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The flashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS and an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.  The INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains of a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky glass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for his face.  He has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and ever-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should be. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.  We've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.  43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT RORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk dainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood. Offhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL. He tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his trenchcoat pocket.  44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT The beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls, and settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet. RORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive suits.  He shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on the wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP. THUMP.  He pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully along the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a CONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing a SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.  He reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a bizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit, rows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed PHOTOGRAPH.  RORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman, all dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is wearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's costume.  They're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT. METROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH himself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we  DISSOLVE TO:  45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT A LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner store.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with the heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated -- old before his time.  He holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough to open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.  46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT In an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in progress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in knot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG sees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious decision to move on.  Then --  VOICE Hold up, papa-san!  The KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and spotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they march toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them, almost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we  CUT TO:  47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE Slow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the gimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place in a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.  It's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in an alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of fists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--  -- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME, transporting us back to:  48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT Real-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF WHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the alley.  LOUDSPEAKER HALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --  The KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the LIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair some forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of the kids.  DREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the alleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past help.  49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The security system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's apartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.  DREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs it carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for the kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most peculiar sight:  DREIBERG . . . Rorschach.  50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT Leaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is the aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up, exposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of baked beans.  DREIBERG How did you get in here?  Ignoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping, utterly emotionless whisper:  RORSCHACH Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.  DREIBERG Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?  DREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less -- emits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can onto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup from a squeeze bottle.  DREIBERG (cont.) I can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're wanted on fourteen counts of murder.  RORSCHACH At least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.  He reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it to DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his fingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Look familiar?  DREIBERG Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.  RORSCHACH Human bean juice. (beat) The Comedian is dead.  DREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture. His jaw goes slack.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Had a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up -- beautiful view. Hope he enjoyed it on the way down.  DREIBERG Jesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?  RORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.  DREIBERG (cont.) Well, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he must've had enemies.  RORSCHACH So do I.  So do you.  DREIBERG Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.  RORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG blinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But RORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the front door.  RORSCHACH Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge. (pause) Thought you might want to spread the word.  DREIBERG Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?  RORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He opens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.  RORSCHACH You the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.  He reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo from the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.  DREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone, CAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple tunic and mask . . .  51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT A GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is far from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome desk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is ADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's DREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and pale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.  VEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic patents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his office reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the like.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE RINGS.  VEIDT Veidt here.  52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT DREIBERG Adrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach. I had to call you before he --  VEIDT Daniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?  DREIBERG The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.  VEIDT My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?  DREIBERG It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.  VEIDT Us.  You mean the Watchmen.  The big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red fur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a chunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders DREIBERG's words.  VEIDT (cont.) Daniel, Rorschach is insane.  DREIBERG I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.  VEIDT You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.  DREIBERG He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.  VEIDT If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I? (slight pause) Do you need money?  DREIBERG No.  I just wanted you to --  VEIDT You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.  DREIBERG Good night.  VEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a cigarette.  It's ""matchless""; you ignite it guy striking the tip of the cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a long, slow drag.  CUT TO:  53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT Barbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the checkpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE rolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign which reads ""ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.""  54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT ADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED ESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door with a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a six-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .  . . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple doorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and wait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.  The inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned woman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK SPECTRE.  LAURIE Adrian.  VEIDT Laurie!  Good to see you.  She gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall in perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.  LAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized machines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific paraphernalia of every description.  VEIDT (cont.) Nice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?  LAURIE Don't rub it in.  I live here.  VEIDT And how's life with the walking H-bomb?  LAURIE He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.  She takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT wanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A SMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:  VEIDT Hi, Jon.  DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.) (a deep, booming voice) Hello, Adrian.  DR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under any circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan. Forty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a calibration atop his particle accelerator.  DR. MANHATTAN (cont.) I think I'm about to detect a gluino.  In case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just about anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the physical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of time and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.  Any government would be glad to have him.  VEIDT Supersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann caught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .  LAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.  LAURIE Please, you guys, no shop talk. (to DR. MANHATTAN) Jon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?  DR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable six-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist -- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:  LAURIE (cont.) Good to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?  He tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.  VEIDT . . . Are we being monitored?  DR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the little red ""ON"" lights wink out.  DR. MANHATTAN The bearer of bad news.  VEIDT We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.  LAURIE Blake?  Dead?  DR. MANHATTAN Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.  LAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first she's heard about it.  VEIDT Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen.  DR. MANHATTAN Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.  VEIDT What's your theory?  DR. MANHATTAN Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.  VEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is considerably less amused.  LAURIE I could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?  VEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another part of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as we watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and floats off to one side.  A module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of the hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in midair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and reassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.  VEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes the conversation without missing a beat:  VEIDT I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.  DR. MANHATTAN You mean Afghanistan? (beat) It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.  The module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The cover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws itself shut.  VEIDT Well . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as usual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye, Jon.  DR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds his coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she arrives with two stiff drinks in hand.  LAURIE Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --  VEIDT I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.  LAURIE Please.  There's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his shoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing with his superaccelerator.  VEIDT He's a little farther gone every time.  LAURIE Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human. (beat) He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.  VEIDT Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.  LAURIE (embarrassed) I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --  VEIDT What about you?  LAURIE I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I. (pause) I'll ring for the guards.  She goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her, concerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest pocket for a cigarette case:  VEIDT Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine. (handing her a cigarette) Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.  LAURIE Maybe I'll do that.  VEIDT I'm sorry about Blake.  He pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS appear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.  LAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman lover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and WALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.  CUT TO:  55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT A decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood, popular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow stairway which dips well below street level.  56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT The usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS hover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS stand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and grind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.  Over by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE off the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of vicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the bar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing glasses.  RORSCHACH Harry.  HARRY (petrified) R-Rorschach.  RORSCHACH Phone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?  He reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH picks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS and yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.  He turns and faces the assembled multitudes:  RORSCHACH Edward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had help. (wandering through the room) Thought maybe you could fill me in.  ENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as RORSCHACH strolls past.  RORSCHACH (cont.) You.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing? (moving on) Johnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?  Behind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively toward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar, yanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Nicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?  NICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH extends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --  -- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He closes a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and SNAPS IT.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Edward Blake.  Who killed him?  No answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH grabs his index finger and repeats the process.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Who killed Edward Blake?  NICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to the floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let fly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.  VOICE JESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!  RORSCHACH THE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?  By now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar. Without looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It catches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of glassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the ceiling.  SILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He looks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:  RORSCHACH (cont.) So many vermin . . . so little time.  He bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it contemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long enough to HISS at the crowd:  RORSCHACH (cont.) Go back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be around.   CUT TO:  57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN The bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller research complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and LAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over to where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is empty.  LAURIE (muttering; groggy) Jon . . . ?  A LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE closes her eyes and sighs.  DR. MANHATTAN I'm here, Laurie.  LAURIE Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?  DR. MANHATTAN Not yet, there's plenty of time.  A SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly. DR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.  LAURIE Mmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?  The BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm, toward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.  DR. MANHATTAN Would you like me to stay?  LAURIE Mm hmm.  DR. MANHATTAN I could stay and go.  LAURIE . . . And just how would you manage that?  She leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its downward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is massaging LAURIE's thigh.  Third blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly wide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.  DR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the foot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.  LAURIE AAAAAAAAAA!!  DR. MANHATTAN I Laurie?  Are you --  DR. MANHATTAN II Don't be upset.  This unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's fragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a dressing gown.  LAURIE Jon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one person again, please?  The big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical gestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.  DR. MANHATTAN I Laurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --  DR. MANHATTAN II -- you would find it erotic.  LAURIE All right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy in this place, I --  While fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance through a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment, she sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an experiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through the door . . .  58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER . . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:  LAURIE You've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your stupid experiments --  DR. MANHATTAN III Yes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.  LAURIE So you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how could you do this?  DR. MANHATTAN III You seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case? (pause) I thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.  LAURIE That's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you can --  She doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered the room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:  DR. MANHATTANS I & II Laurie, please --  LAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back slowly, steadies herself on a lab table.  LAURIE Jon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I could really use the time alone.  She storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I & II -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original DR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his equipment.  FADE THROUGH TO:  1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT A pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard at work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly beautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely wasted on her preoccupied date.  At the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:  LAURIE The government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I guess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman. (mock-macho) I have to keep him in line.  She flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to laugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has wandered off into a far corner of the room.  LAURIE (cont.) Excuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?  DREIBERG Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?  LAURIE Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.  DREIBERG Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .  LAURIE Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.  DREIBERG Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --  Now he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then leans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:  LAURIE Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.  DREIBERG (shaking his head in disgust)  Yeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors . . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.  LAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.  DREIBERG (cont.) What's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?  LAURIE I'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could see yourself right now. (raising her glass) Well, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . . and we're not.  DREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.  1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace, which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters of brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.  DREIBERG The pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I mean, we were heroes!  LAURIE Damn straight.  DREIBERG Damn straight!  We were heroes.  LAURIE Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.  DREIBERG Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .  LAURIE (smiling) Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .  DREIBERG Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?  LAURIE That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?  DREIBERG (deadpan) He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.  LAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to her mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA PULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a stentorian VOICE over scene:  CHAPLAIN (V.O.) In the midst of life we are in death . . .  CUT TO:  59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY AN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.  CHAPLAIN . . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall change our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --  TIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of mourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the attendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons of protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off with the traditional twenty-one gun salute.  CHAPLAIN (cont.) -- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself.  A light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR. MANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish miraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the distance, and he glances off at:  60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT SENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the cemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has been spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like wildfire.  MOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the cemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due respect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo: gawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their hands full managing the crowd.  A KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to join the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.  It's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled marble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward, and he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms, Pieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze plaque bears the inscription:  IN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM  Below it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four hundred of them.  61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT The Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet home.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her through.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind her, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.  62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT LAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex, fumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the card into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.  She tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls up behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps out.  LAURIE Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.  ADAMSON Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.  LAURIE Why?  What's the problem?  ADAMSON I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.  LAURIE (chuckling) I would like to use the bathroom --  As she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.  ADAMSON The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.  LAURIE What?!  ADAMSON Please.  The major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The GUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.  ADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she sees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.  The entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging from it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION SUITS.  63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT LAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to a team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard at the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white gown:  NURSE Miss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.  LAURIE What -- ?  DOCTOR Drink this.  The DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She stares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.  DOCTOR Drink it.  64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT TECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are shifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of a human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens on:  65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT We're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A donut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot, foot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to the anteroom.  Through a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head wedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right as she wonders just what the hell is going on.  66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT A MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.  LAURIE (O.S.) That's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.  LAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table surrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent SCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken from a thick sheaf.  LAURIE (cont.) Dr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The quantum-whatever.  SCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the Watchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE hesitates.  LAURIE (cont.) That's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt. (long pause) Rorschach . . .  SCHMIDT Their real names, please.  LAURIE I don't know their real names.  SCHMIDT You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.  LAURIE I don't know their real names!  SCHMIDT You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give. (holding up the sheaf of photos) These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --  LAURIE Then why don't you ask him?!?  Furious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby window.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced torturers, they understand the value of patience.  LAURIE (cont.) I want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.  One of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out for LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door opens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.  He passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and tilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with curiosity:  LAURIE (cont.) Someone had better tell me what's going on here!  SCHMIDT Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well. (beat) They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.  LAURIE What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?  All at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes bone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she takes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.  SCHMIDT I'm terribly sorry.  LAURIE What does this mean?  What does it --  SCHMIDT Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.  LAURIE That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --  She scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to his comrades, and heads for the door.  SCHMIDT Take a day or two.  If you ""remember"" any names . . . do give us a call.  The AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches for the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking, she buries her face in her hands.  67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT A darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a two-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been watching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.  ADAMSON Poor kid.  SCHMIDT We'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.  ADAMSON To hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc Manhattan.  SCHMIDT What do you mean?  ADAMSON She's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows which way he'll jump.  DISSOLVE TO:  68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY DR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing a navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie with an irregular mauve pattern.  The tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie magically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal gold stripes.  Too staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into a handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for decoration.  It does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the mirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.  69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY TECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green room, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.  DIRECTOR We're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is that big blue son of a --  He stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just rematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's face.  DR. MANHATTAN I'm sorry.  Am I late?  DIRECTOR No problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm Kent Turner, the director. . .  The DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a hallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.  LIAISON Dr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to steer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll just play it cool --  DIRECTOR Doc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give us something a little darker . . . ?  DR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.  DR. MANHATTAN Will this do?  DIRECTOR Perfect.  LIAISON Now Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --  But the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by a cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are hurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON hangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The ""ABC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT"" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC underneath.  70. INSERT - TV MONITOR Stock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for their lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right and takes in an extraordinary sight.  A towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through the jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the greenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts of automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation crew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: ""VIETNAM.  1965.""  ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Dr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific mishap.  For more than twenty years the ""Manhattan Option"" has been the linchpin of America's conventional strategy --  We CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad thoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds a corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.  His EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey gunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM hisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met with a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads: ""CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.""  ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.) -- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a one-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding the Communist menace in check.  DANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from American Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake hands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a three-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic accord.  Title: ""NICARAGUA.  1979.""  ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.) In the famous words of General William Westmoreland, ""Yes, Virginia, there is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American.""  71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY A sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop of the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded news vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:  BRINKLEY For this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by correspondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating, I'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy. (turning) Now let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better known to the world as Dr. Manhattan.  Applause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at BRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.  BRINKLEY (cont.) I suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan, where Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now since you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past . . . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that you intervene?  DR. MANHATTAN I will not intervene in Afghanistan.  A HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.  72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON Looking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.  73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN HANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience. BRINKLEY ignores them:  BRINKLEY You're saying you would refuse a direct request?  DR. MANHATTAN There will be no request.  I will not intervene.  BRINKLEY Well, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can actually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the hostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?  74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON He's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on DR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE in the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:  LIAISON I want a phone line to the booth.  Now.  75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN DR. MANHATTAN I see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it. (long pause) I can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will not intervene.  He sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.  BRINKLEY Well, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll open up the floor to questions now.  Doug?  REPORTER Dr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read you some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M. Weaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?  DR. MANHATTAN All friends, yes.  Associates of mine.  ROTH Let me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White. Are you aware that these ""friends"" and ""associates"" of yours have all been diagnosed with terminal cancer?  The CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He gapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face an unreadable mask.  76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON eyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone  LIAISON Oh Jesus. (barking into phone) I want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I have to!  77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN ROTH I have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly diagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a connection?  By now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make himself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message from the booth, touches his headset and announces:  BRINKLEY I'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief message --  Within seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set, flanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.  LIAISON THAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!  The three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then, PANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB THE SET.  RANDOM NEWSMEN Dr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause cancer??  DR. MANHATTAN I don't wish to answer any questions.  RANDOM NEWSMEN You see the future!  Did you know in advance --  LIAISON The Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP ASIDE!!  The LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but the mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.  RANDOM NEWSMEN How long have you known -- why is the government concealing this information --  DR. MANHATTAN Please get out of my way.  The LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor. SCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN lets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:  DR. MANHATTAN I said LEAVE ME ALONE!!  In the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no microphones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR. MANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.  BRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later, there's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES, leaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.  CUT TO:  78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT The place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is overseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post quarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised when DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.  DR. MANHATTAN Where's Laurie?  ADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and he's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely necessary.  ADAMSON She's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .  DR. MANHATTAN There's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the results positive?  ADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.  DR. MANHATTAN (cont.) Don't bother.  I already know what you'll say.  He watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His mind is already a million miles away.  ADAMSON Jon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . . could you cure her?  DR. MANHATTAN I don't know.  I only know that I won't. (long pause) There'd be no point.  It's finally begun.  ADAMSON ""Begun?""  What's begun?  DR. MANHATTAN I've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years. (pause) You see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I cared for . . .  ADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down his spine nonetheless.  DR. MANHATTAN My work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.  And with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves behind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at the Major's feet.  ADAMSON Good Lord --  CUT TO:  79. EXT. OUTER SPACE -- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few hundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily apparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily beautiful -- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white clouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing our planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.  It's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on nothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage. Stars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to leave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.  80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT Black sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so barren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is, until we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined quonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements, half-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than husks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a rotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.  A gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden RUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue light.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift in the sky and descends gently to earth.  The rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once more as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town of Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was once a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long mahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.  A desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We MOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and  DISSOLVE TO:  81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY It's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN -- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie and a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing a dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:  JANEY SLATER (O.S.) Nineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they could at least make us a decent hamburger.  JON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten with DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple of years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just close enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's probably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush JON has on her.  JON I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.  JANEY With lots of ketchup?  Smiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a bottle on his french fries.  JON Nothing wrong with ketchup.  JANEY Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?  JON Anything for science, I guess. (long, hesitant pause) Janey, there's something --  JANEY (simultaneously) We should get back -- (realizing she's cut him off) What?  JON Nothing.  What were you going to say?  JANEY We should get back to the lab. (staring at him; chuckling) You okay, Jon?  He stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he pipes up:  JON Oh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.  The lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads for the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after JANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.  His face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up behind her.  JANEY Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --  JON (blurting it out) Janey, will you marry me?  She turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the pained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the verdict.  JANEY Jon -- what?  JON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes locked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the canteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the door, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and one of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled JANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.  There's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private trance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.  WALLY Christ, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.  JANEY Oh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --  JON I can fix it.  JANEY -- What?  JON My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.  He holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.  WALLY Take him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.  Chuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY hands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her with basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his answer.  But before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket. He thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --  JON Here.  I'll trade you.  -- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING. With a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but he's already gone.  She stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.  82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY JON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center of the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S TOOLS.  It's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the central screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal into its housing and gives it a light tap.  With a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love, remember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed with oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST CHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of it are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like anti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.  He stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and walks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK from the direction of the test chamber.  Mounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes, seconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON eyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to the reinforced steel door of the chamber.  Inside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a low platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it hears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the concrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.  JON C'mon, little guy, outta here . . .  The mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in hand.  JON (cont.) . . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.  He stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch inside.  He looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting. Agitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the doorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of the concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete block, reaches for the watch --  -- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.  White-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete block -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of the support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.  Before his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place -- TRAPPING HIM INSIDE.  He LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps sliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams shut.  83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT 1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One of them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of MILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the facilities.  SCIENTIST -- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the intrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few concrete blocks all to hell.  GENERAL (joking, but worried) No danger of . . . fallout, is there?  SCIENTIST No sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why we waited outside.  The translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a dull red.  The crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant THUMPING.  The SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect unison.  GENERAL What's the matter?  SCIENTIST Sweet Jesus -- !  We DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of the test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the terrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass, screaming soundlessly.  Pandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left, punching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes to a belated and painfully obvious realization:  GENERAL Say, there's a man in there!!  The coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One SCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --  SCIENTIST I Stay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!  -- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:  SCIENTIST II Building six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F. chamber!!  The GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.  GENERAL Well -- why doesn't someone let him out??  SCIENTIST III It's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence starts. (to SCIENTIST II) What's the word?  SCIENTIST II (covering the phone) They're sending a crew to the generator building --  SCIENTIST IV TWENTY SECONDS!  In a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions ""IN CASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.""  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the canteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the glass, and grabs the ax.  SCIENTIST I Wally!  What are you doing?  WALLY The power cables!!  And now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY SLATER.  JANEY Am I late for the --  She stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the lab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back through the door.  SCIENTIST III Janey!  Get her out of here.  Get out!  But she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to take a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils have just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.  JANEY What in the name of -- where's Jon?  SCIENTIST III Janey!  Please!  Go!!  WALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a sudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a wall.  Sparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white light.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look at the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.  JANEY Jon.  84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT JON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his face.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch, which he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters . . .  . . . and everything in the room goes blue.  85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT The SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to tear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind them.  JANEY Jon . . . (shrieking) JON!!!  86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT JON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of unbelievable agony.  A moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a photographic negative -- stands in his place.  Then the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The iridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to pieces.  And then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim, and we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of the SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY, who gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.  DISSOLVE TO:  87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT The desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall behind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago at 11:48 PM.  For a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches the rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the door of the canteen.  88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.  89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT TWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into the mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous thing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal cord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous system.  They pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in a haze of shimmering blue light.  90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.  91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT HORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A partially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS for several seconds before vanishing altogether.  92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.  93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT Dinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.  JANEY I can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it feels haunted.  WALLY It'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all. (tugging at his ear) Do you hear some kind of -- whistling?  Indeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine. Odder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's. Everyone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish phenomenon.  UTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without warning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW suffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .  . . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them, nude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and utensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.  JANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go to her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.  JANEY JON-N-N-N!!!  DISSOLVE TO:  94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT THE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns, stares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and begins to dig.  A couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient, tattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and Janey Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new engagement ring.  His fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.  95. SERIES OF SHOTS Quick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:  -- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;  -- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue light;  -- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper. There's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a terrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .  -- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom cloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.  96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN Fists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in the ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at first, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue starburst a mile above the ground.  97. EXT. OUTER SPACE All at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth at unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on toward Mars.  The red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame as we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface. Individual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct: vast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri. Herschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre planitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling two jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular ridge.  Two eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a happy-face.  Many miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian atmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we  CUT TO:  98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN The late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN's press conference. As the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on his angered face:  DR. MANHATTAN I said leave me alone!!  Then there's a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same positions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on the White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.  PULL BACK TO:  99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT A restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair. She's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the big metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy furnished studio.  TV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.) -- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported a crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania Avenue!  TV ANCHORMAN (O.S.) Well, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --  LAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later, SCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.  SCHMIDT All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.  LAURIE Am I free to go?  SCHMIDT You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.  LAURIE (fed up; exploding) I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --  SCHMIDT Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.  LAURIE Jon??  You mean he's --  SCHMIDT That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.  CUT TO:  100. EXT. NEWSTAND - DAY The same headlines scream from every edition on the rack:  DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH Russian Tanks Advance President Vows ""Maximum Force"" WHERE IS DR. MANHATTAN?  And on the street, tensions are running high.  The familiar NEWS VENDOR is engaged in a heated exchange with one of his CUSTOMERS:  NEWS VENDOR I'll tell you what the problem is.  We shoulda been building tanks, bombs, ICBM's!  Instead we been relying on that big blue son of a bitch --  CUSTOMER Anyone ever tell you you're full of shit?  NEWS VENDOR Kiss my ass, buddy!  Keep your goddamn quarter!  VOICE New Frontiersman, please.  The NEWS VENDOR turns suddenly, finds himself confronted by an old friend: the red-haired STREET CRAZY with the end-of-the-world sign. He rolls his eyes -- this is all I need -- and reaches under the counter.  NEWS VENDOR Here you go, pal.  Two bucks. (beat) Well, I see the world ain't ended yet.  The STREET CRAZY eyes the lurid cover of his magazine.  ""EXPOSED: RED PLOT TO FRAME DR. MANHATTAN!""  STREET CRAZY . . . How do you know?  CUT TO:  101. EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT A row of decayed walk-ups in a fringe neighborhood downtown.  A DRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight WOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and off as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging tipsy giggles.  102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT A three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN ushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY; his is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed -- we'll call him MOLOCH.  MOLOCH Now.  What was milady drinking?  LUCY Gin.  Straight up -- (mock-ladylike)  -- with a little twist of lime.  She laughs convulsively, as if she's just told the world's funniest joke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:  MOLOCH I think I can oblige.  103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT MOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The contents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen floor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a disaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in the doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.  LUCY Jeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?  On cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH. He grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen table.  RORSCHACH Moloch.  Did you miss me?  LUCY Willie!  Jesus!  What's going on?  RORSCHACH (glancing up) Who's the welfare mother?  MOLOCH I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.  RORSCHACH Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.  MOLOCH You're making a big --  RORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against the table -- repeatedly, to the beat.  RORSCHACH Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.  MOLOCH ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?  LUCY Willie, what's he talking about?  RORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor. RORSCHACH kneels beside him.  MOLOCH Look, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for ten years.  I --  RORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him close.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:  RORSCHACH Turned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face. (twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look) Hnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.  He shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar bowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as MOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Comedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's behind it?  MOLOCH Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --  RORSCHACH Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.  MOLOCH CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --  RORSCHACH Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.  LUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as RORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when he stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:  RORSCHACH (cont.) Word of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.  -- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously at MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking about.  CUT TO:  104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY The familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a big round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world looming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a MILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight POINTER, highlighting areas of strategic importance.  ANALYST Our projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there it's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.  GENERAL Respectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They're quizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.  MOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which bears the seal of the President of the United States.  PRESIDENT First strike. (long pause) I'd like to view the simulation.  The ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.  ANALYST Optimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of their retaliatory capability before they knew what hit 'em.  On the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the Pacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf -- blossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION SYMBOLS as they strike their targets.  PRESIDENT What about our end?  ANALYST Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.  On the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.  ANALYST (cont.) Britain down -- Germany down --  PRESIDENT What kind of time frame are we talking about?  ANALYST Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.  RADIATION SYMBOLS sprout over New York, Baltimore, Washington, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco.  PRESIDENT . . . Of course.  By now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a dedicated optimist, turns to announce:  ANALYST As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.  PRESIDENT What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter"" theory?  ANALYST We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.  PRESIDENT The weather.  I see. (pause) Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.  The SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G. Gordon Liddy -- pipes up:  SECRETARY LIDDY Dick, before we act hastily, we should consider . . . Dr. Manhattan may decide to return.  With a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the table -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined and tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he's none other than that beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at 74.  PRESIDENT (cont.) Good God.  At times like this I wish I'd never come out of retirement.  CUT TO:  105. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY A private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an examination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the doorway.  DOCTOR I'm sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.  LAURIE Not at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.  106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK A greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near the entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken tandoori.  DREIBERG Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . . (pause) How about you, Laurie?  LAURIE (lying -- with forced cheer) Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out. (shrugging) No expense account.  No place to live.  DREIBERG You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .  LAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.  LAURIE They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.  DREIBERG Maybe not, but why take chances?  LAURIE Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --  -- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a damper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts to get up.  LAURIE I'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find myself a cheap room.  DREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the door of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and chases her down:  DREIBERG Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --  DREIBERG No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.  LAURIE You're sure?  He nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the restaurant.  THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the street outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of frame, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of ketchup.  He inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down question mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he opens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.  107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET A SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant, then disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls casually down the alleyway.  He moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the crumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a small recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a shifting INKBLOT MASK.  108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style: flowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc. It's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative ""aah"" as DREIBERG ushers her in.  LAURIE This is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.  DREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands there for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.  LAURIE (cont.) Are you . . . waiting for a tip?  DREIBERG Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --  LAURIE I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?  She gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her unpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.  109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG As he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE unbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door shut.  110. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT DREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds his hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.  111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE Another quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE -- LAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off valiantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.  An oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into frame; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP overhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and snatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.  112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG. His head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom adjacent.  He's going to be awake half the night thinking of LAURIE.  CUT TO:  113. EXT. STREET - DAY Early morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in an alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and crewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.  MOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA DINER.  114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER A twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and pulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the nose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges of his EYELIDS.  His eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper; bizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it up . . .  There's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.  A low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and sees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.  He GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and holds the stall door shut.  RORSCHACH Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.  MOLOCH No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.  A long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.  MOLOCH (cont.) There's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on a case, trying to track 'em down. (beat) It's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all I've been able to find out.  RORSCHACH Drug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh. (snarling) Let it go time.  In future -- just say no.  With that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits there a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won't open.  MOLOCH HEY!!  RORSCHACH's stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the adjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we  CUT TO:  115. INT. VEIDT'S PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY A plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it's decorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in an overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he's in the process of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure who's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.  JUSTINE Now Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know. Are you the world's smartest man?  VEIDT Oh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.  A round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!  JUSTINE You're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty basic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday lives. (pause) If you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?  VEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls out his gold cigarette case.  VEIDT Sphinx brand. (opening the case) When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it? (lighting up) In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?  JUSTINE Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --  VEIDT (bristling) No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.  JUSTINE Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.  VEIDT No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --  VEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent. He glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.  VEIDT (cont.) -- we agreed specifically --  MORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting curious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.  VEIDT (cont.) Excuse me a second.  He goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley JUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.  116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY VEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with his mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:  VEIDT KITTY!!  One last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet -- no visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his dignity.  VEIDT (cont.) How the hell did you get in here?  The curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He looks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass window.  RORSCHACH New information.  VEIDT (pointing to the telephone) Ever see one of these before?  RORSCHACH Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.  VEIDT What is that ungodly smell?  RORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark HISS.  RORSCHACH Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .  VEIDT Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now. (beat) And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.  RORSCHACH Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.  He makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.  CUT TO:  117. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a broiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and cursing.  LAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full glass of wine and thrusts it at him.  LAURIE Daniel -- drink this.  Immediately. (smiling) I swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.  Sucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.  DREIBERG Okay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think of you as Dr. Manhattan's --  He catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.  LAURIE His what?  DREIBERG His . . . whatever.  LAURIE I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?  She spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward the dining room.  LAURIE Look, I just want to eat dinner and get drunk.  Let's not make it any more difficult than we have to, huh?  118. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN The latest bad news from half a world away:  NEWS ANCHOR Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the fighting continues to escalate . . .  On a televised MAP of Afghanistan, RED RUSSIAN ARROWS are working their way slowly but inexorably toward Pakistani territory.  NEWS ANCHOR (cont.) With Russian forces approaching the border, Pakistan today called on the US to intervene.  President Nixon has placed America's European military installations on full alert --  CAMERA PULLS BACK, placing us in --  119. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT A DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty dishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in dismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.  DREIBERG Good Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball game.  LAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much interest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo cabinet.  LAURIE That's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game. (smiling) God!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.  She's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it are row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's items.  DREIBERG I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.  LAURIE I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago. (flipping through records) Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.  DREIBERG Play one.  Educate yourself.  LAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar COMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and gazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.  LAURIE Oh look.  It's Adrian's ad.  TV CHORUS ""Oh my darling, it's incredible, That someone so unforgettable . . .""  120. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT MOLOCH's apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as RORSCHACH lets himself in.  TV CHORUS "". . . Should think I am unforgettable too.""  RORSCHACH Moloch?  No reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera, seemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance around the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen, the WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her face:  TV ANNOUNCER The years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and wrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming NOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses the aging process . . .  RORSCHACH Moloch?  He creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.  121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH staring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND BULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and spins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --  TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.) For the smooth young face he'll never forget --  122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT LAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the TV ad.  TV ANNOUNCER -- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.  DREIBERG No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?  LAURIE Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!  DREIBERG I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?  LAURIE I like the way you look. (beat) It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .  DREIBERG Old?  LAURIE Not at all.  You look very -- dashing. (standing up) Here, you pick one.  DREIBERG . . . What?  LAURIE Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.  Her tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then, with a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.  123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT RORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:  LOUDSPEAKER RORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO COME OUT.  He goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street outside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A CTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.  LOUDSPEAKER YOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!  He's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES -- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.  124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller tune, ""S'posin'.""  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces illuminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile she reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt pocket.  Dreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making him nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her hands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so that he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on his mouth.  The PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:  ""S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . . Do you think that you could love me too . . .""  125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS) SONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a horrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying a plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans -- ordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around under the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid, rubbing alcohol, Drano.  Almost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the burners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.  ""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . . Would it impress you . . .""  126. INT. TENEMENT - FRONT STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS) A contingent of ARMED CTU MEN rushing silently up the stairs.  ""Or would it distress you?  Hmm?""  127. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS) RORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and rubbing alcohol.  There's a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied -- resting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the front door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the hallway just outside the living room.  The door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH strikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN -- creating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the puddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF BOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.  ""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . . (Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.) Would you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . .""  128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in disarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky, unable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going well.  ""S'posin' I declare it Would you take my love and share it? I'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . .""  He wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her breast.  129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS) INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through the kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.  He empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he ducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.  130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS) RORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper into its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from the smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov cocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.  The COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit the floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.  RORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is coming up with back way behind him.  131. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER (MOS) Charred COPS, leaping FLAMES.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the GAS STOVE.  132. EXT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS) A GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE hails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:  ""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you? . . . Would it impress you? . . .""  133. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT LAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG's pants.  Finally he can't stand it anymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and sits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she doesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side, embracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.  "". . . Or would it distress you?""  134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS) RORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level. By now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU COPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.  He still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for his last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket, where it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.  ""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . . Would you think I'm speaking out of turn . . .""  The COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He steps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their weapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.  The COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as RORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.  135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT RORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the face.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a blimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the roof.  ""S'posin' I declare it. Would you take my love and share it? . . .""  RORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE ESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front of the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on the street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and tries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed AIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.  ""I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you.""  The song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL OF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street below.  136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT Three stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and lies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on him instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle butts.  COPS GET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!  RORSCHACH GNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!  In seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face topped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar face . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand with his placards announcing the end of the world.  COP Christ.  He's got five-inch heels.  The fuckin' runt wears elevator shoes!  RORSCHACH NO!!  NO!!  GIVE IT BACK!!  He kicks and claws at the COPS as they drag him unceremoniously off to a nearby van.  COP II So that's the terror of the underworld.  That ugly little zero.  RORSCHACH GIVE ME BACK MY FACE!!!  The van doors slam shut on RORSCHACH -- just as the first FIRE TRUCKS arrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement.  CUT TO:  137. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE stretched out on the sofa, under a blanket.  He stares up at the ceiling, still troubled.  DREIBERG I'm sorry, Laurie.  I --  LAURIE It's all right, Dan.  I just want you to hold me, okay?  -- Just hold me.  For a few moments she lies nestled peacefully against his chest.  His gaze drifts over to the TV.  Suddenly he BLANCHES.  LAURIE Daniel.  What --  On the TV screen is a huge bluescreen closeup of RORSCHACH.  DANIEL reaches for the remote control to turn up the volume.  TV ANCHOR . . . A ten-year manhunt ended tonight with the capture of the masked vigilante known as Rorschach.  Eight CTU men died in the violent confrontation at a downtown tenement . . .  The news report CUTS LIVE to the smoking wreckage of the tenement.  LAURIE Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.  DREIBERG Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.  Now the screen shows side-by-side closeups of the inkblot mask and the acne-scarred face beneath it.  LAURIE looks on, transfixed.  TV ANCHOR . . . identified as Walter Joseph Kovacs, 44, a transient with a history of psychological disorders.  A former landlord described Kovacs as a self-confessed loner and political extremist:  LANDLORD (ON TV) All kinda weirdo literature, paraphernalia . . . you shoulda seen that place when I threw him out.  Talk about pigpens --  LAURIE hits the mute button, settles back and lets out a low whistle.  DREIBERG, distracted, pours a glass of wine and gets up to pace the room.  LAURIE I just realized.  I'd never seen his face. (beat) I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?  DREIBERG The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.  He stares at her, obviously wondering: who's next?  138. EXT. NEWS KIOSK - EVENING The familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID -- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement nearby, reading a comic book.  The NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic little number entitled ""COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS.""  NEWS VENDOR Hey, this ain't a lending library.  I expect you to pay me for that.  KID No way.  This one sucks.  A CUSTOMER -- 50, black, on the tubby side -- stops at the newsstand.  His name is DR. MALCOLM LONG.  DR. LONG Gazette, please.  The NEWS VENDOR hands over a copy of the Gazette.  The cover bears side-by-side photos of RORSCHACH and his alter ego, KOVACS, with the banner headline: ""CTU APPREHENDS MASKED KILLER.""  NEWS VENDOR 'Dyou see this?  This guy's a customer of mine! (shaking his head) I mean, I always knew he was a little flaky, but -- wild, huh?  You never know.  LONG hands over a quarter, unfolds the paper and begins to read as he wanders off down the street.  139. STUDY - NIGHT DR. LONG, who happens to be a police psychiatrist, sits at a big desk with a vast heap of paperwork -- which includes a mug sheet of RORSCHACH (minus the mask) and a neatly-typed arrest report from the NYPD:  NAME: Kovacs, Walter Joseph ADDRESS: Transient BORN: 3/21/43 MOTHER'S NAME: Kovacs, Sylvia J. (nee Glick) FATHER'S NAME: Unknown  By now LONG is working on his third pot of coffee.  His wife, SYLVIA, wanders in behind him, dressed for bed in her robe and slippers.  When she rests her hands on his shoulders, he nearly jumps out of his seat.  DR. LONG Oh!  Sorry.  I didn't hear you.  SYLVIA How much longer? (staring down at the desk) It's that vigilante, isn't it.  That --  DR. LONG Rorschach (correcting himself) Kovacs.  Incredible case.  Blinded two children at the age of ten. We pulled his record from the juvenile home --  Without looking up he shoves a sheaf of papers in SYLVIA's direction.  DR. LONG (cont.) No father.  Mother a prostitute.  Some evidence of systematic child abuse . . . (swiveling to face her) Classic case of misplaced aggression.  You know, these vigilantes, these ""Watchmen"" -- there's never been a systematic study to find out just what makes them do it.  SYLVIA Malcolm, don't get too -- overwhelmed by all this.  SYLVIA picks up a blurry xerox of a child's drawing: TWO HIDEOUS FIGURES, male and female, with wild eyes, fangs, and matted hair. They're conjoined like Siamese twins at the mouth, belly, and crotch.  This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title ""MY DREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13.""  It's too strong to look at for long.  She sets it down with a shiver.  SYLVIA (cont.) Why don't you come to bed?  DR. LONG (totally engrossed) I'd like to get my hands on some of the others.  Explosive material. (grabbing a transcript)  Mother died when he was fourteen.  When they told him, he had one word of comment: ""Good.""  SYLVIA shoots him a hard look, shakes her head almost imperceptibly, and gives up.  She turns and pads silently out of the room.  LONG goes right on talking, unaware that his audience has left.  DR. LONG (cont.) Still, he's not stupid.  In some ways he's got an extraordinary mind.  I think I can reach him. (nodding his head) I can reach him.  CUT TO:  140. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY A bare, windowless chamber, 10' by 10'.  LONG and RORSCHACH sit in folding chairs on opposite sides of a square table.  The doctor reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a stack of CARDS.  DR. LONG Now, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look at each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All right?  RORSCHACH's face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.  DR. LONG turns up the first card, a symmetrical inkblot, part of a Rorschach test.  RORSCHACH Butterfly.  LONG nods, makes a notation on a pad, turns up the next card.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Some nice flowers.  LONG eyes him skeptically, makes another note, turns up the third card.  RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.  RORSCHACH (cont.) A doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.  He shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of frustration.  DR. LONG Walter --  RORSCHACH Don't call me that.  DR. LONG Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.  RORSCHACH Wrong answers?  DR. LONG There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you. (pause) I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.  RORSCHACH Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.  LONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this. He shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under the table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.  DR. LONG Well, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide to cooperate.  TWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to leave.  He pauses in the doorway.  RORSCHACH Doctor.  You don't want to help me.  You just want to find out what makes me sick. (beat) You'll find out.  -- You'll find out.  CUT TO:  141. INT. VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY A huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns, fountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden. JUSTINE's hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the central escalator and swing into action.  JUSTINE Adrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?  He's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and secretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the cameras.  VEIDT No comment.  JUSTINE Did you know he was back on the streets?  VEIDT I did not.  Now get out of my way!  JUSTINE Isn't it true that you --  He keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a pillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.  ASSASSIN VEIDT!  VEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and comes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's agility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY in his hands.  He swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a FOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.  As the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and slams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King Tut.  VEIDT Son of a bitch.  Who sent you?  Arms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's hair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.  SECURITY GUARD Stand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!  VEIDT He's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you scum, I want to know who sent you!  The ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down into the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.  VEIDT Goddammit . . .  SECURITY GUARD Who'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?  VEIDT I don't know.  I don't know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.  CUT TO:  142. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK TIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.  NEWSCASTER -- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating fears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside St. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from morning Mass --  A PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV, reaches for the receiver.  DREIBERG Yeah. (beat) Adrian!  What's up?  143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG VEIDT In have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it on the news. (beat) Someone tried to kill me today.  For a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether surprised.  DREIBERG Who?  VEIDT I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?  DREIBERG She's with me.  VEIDT Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard. (beat) Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.  DREIBERG Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.  He hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box. LAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off her hair.  LAURIE Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?  DREIBERG One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian. (beat) . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.  He doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks up on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away from him and steadies herself against a bureau.  DREIBERG -- What is it.  LAURIE I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.  DREIBERG Laurie --  LAURIE I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --  DREIBERG With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.  His sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG, fed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over behind her.  LAURIE I shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told you --  But before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from behind.  DREIBERG Laurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than anything else in the world.  CUT TO:  144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT CONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving area.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward the dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby tables:  VOICE Hey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --  VOICE II Rorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --  Low, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH picks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The smallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.  GOON I Didn't know he was such a tiny little thing.  GOON II Little?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.  RORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A SERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.  GOON III I'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. . .  GOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.  GOON III (cont.) Notched up some big names over the years.  Suddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of his dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III follows.  The others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving counter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings a KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and tumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down, into a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.  Landing on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH uses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON II lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby burner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with HOT COOKING FAT.  All this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two disfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked and smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in with billy clubs drawn.  As the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It sounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.  CUT TO:  145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT A prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor -- delivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of the cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are totally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal doors.  At a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door, then throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of RORSCHACH.  TRUSTY Hey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin' man. (beat) Their friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . . this whole place blows.  RORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The TRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.  TRUSTY (cont.) I'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --  RORSCHACH I'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.  With that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.  CUT TO:  146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY LONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a square table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED WIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.  Through a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across the table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of inkblots as before, the ""butterfly"" leading off.  But this time, the subject has decided to cooperate:  RORSCHACH A whore fucking.  DR. LONG Who is she?  Do you know her?  Too obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the ""nice flowers"":  RORSCHACH (cont.) Man's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.  LONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:  RORSCHACH (cont.) Doggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog -- (pause; then, smiling) -- with his skull split open.  DR. LONG And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?  RORSCHACH Why, doctor.  I did. (beat) He was a bad dog.  RORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass tacks.  DR. LONG Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?  RORSCHACH God isn't there to do it.  DR. LONG We don't know that.  RORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.  DR. LONG So the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it? (no response) You tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why would you want to kill a dog?  With LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:  RORSCHACH One night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.  147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK) Ruined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for the distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues OVER SCENE:  RORSCHACH (V.O.) '75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no word.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to intervene.  The lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up his collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a ramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.  RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.) Got a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.  He peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO HUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen object.  148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK) A DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file, flicks on a flashlight.  Mannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The light shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders over.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and on the floor, a ROPE.  There's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it, sticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a charred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with balloons and teddy bears.  He stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden CHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding paraphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's knives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh WINDOW.  RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.) Dogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had gone.  149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK) The German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the dogs until we see what it is they're tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB OF BONE.  RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.) Decided to wait for the owner . . .  150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) Keys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN enters and whistles to the dogs.  FAT MAN Fred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--  RORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.  151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY RORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the story.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his reply, asks:  DR. LONG Then what happened?  RORSCHACH . . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had to break in.  152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) The FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's handcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a GROCERY SACK.  He kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off his glove and reaches into the sack.  FAT MAN What -- what are you d--  RORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER into his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he spends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face, throat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's done, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER BLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.  FRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door, and -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs inside.  Then he stands back and enjoys the carnage.  153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY DR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things up.  RORSCHACH When they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their skulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies. (leaning forward) See, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed her . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did, he did't seem to mind.  DR. LONG That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --  RORSCHACH Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image. (slight smile) What else can I illuminate?  LONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the PRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he points a finger at LONG's inkblot.  RORSCHACH (cont.) No right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . . just a man's face. (pause) See it now?  The GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a couple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a second he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he STOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern on top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.  LONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the Rorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.  DISSOLVE TO:  154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK A rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls up outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to the padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.  After a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.  LAURIE Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?  DREIBERG Memory lane.  He opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.  155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER Inside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.  LAURIE Daniel . . .  DREIBERG Gimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.  She goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull it back to reveal . . .  THE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit tarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight. DREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around to join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.  LAURIE The Owlship.  I can't believe it.  DREIBERG -- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.  156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on the electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin, reliving days gone by.  LAURIE Wow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?  DREIBERG I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.  LAURIE Antarctica??  DREIBERG Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along. (pause) I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.  LAURIE Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.  DREIBERG You and me.  He looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her gaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the cabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly rejected.  DREIBERG . . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there anyway.  Behind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just opened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES -- their old superhero togs.  LAURIE Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.  DREIBERG Me neither.  Mine barely even fits. (chuckling) The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.  LAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing herself in a small mirror above a sink.  LAURIE God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.  DREIBERG What are you up to?  LAURIE Don't look.  Turn around.  Smirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the cabin.  DREIBERG This'd better not be what I think it is.  LAURIE Okay!  DREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite imposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns shock:  DREIBERG (cont.) My God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender of the weak!  LAURIE In the flesh.  She ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind, and strokes his thinning hair.  LAURIE (cont.) Poor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.  DREIBERG Saving the world?  I guess I do. (smiling) Maybe we can still save ourselves . . .  DISSOLVE TO:  157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK A massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned out; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met by CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous BOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and hawks, they're all frightened as hell.  Things are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow. The end is nigh, and passions flare.  It's anarchy waiting to happen.  MAN ON STAGE You know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They're sitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That's right -- a first strike!  VOICE IN CROWD You think the reds ain't doing the same thing?  MAN ON STAGE Then for the love of God let's negotiate.  We can start a war.  But we can't stop it!!  VOICE IN CROWD II It's pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!  VOICE IN CROWD III Dr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!  VOICE IN CROWD IV It's God's judgment!  Jesus is the way!  A HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:  HECKLER Russia's just been waiting for an opening.  They won't show us no mercy.  I say NUKE 'EM NOW!!  MAN ON STAGE You think this is some kind of grudge match??  We're talking the end of the world!!  The two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the stage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start swinging rifle butts.  As PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of HOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides -- outfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials ""CTU""  158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK CTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.  CTU CAPTAIN I've had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.  159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK PANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their midst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.  LOUDSPEAKER CEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.  A couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles, turn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling rocks, brickbats -- whatever's handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.  CUT TO:  160. INT. BARN - DUSK DREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT, wiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:  DREIBERG Guess that ought to do it.  Let's shut her down --  Laurie?  No reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.  161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT LAURIE's standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her face is distraught, agonized.  LAURIE Daniel, you ought to take a look at this.  Onscreen, it's total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the CTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs below.  DREIBERG What the hell -- ?  LAURIE It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.  DREIBERG Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.  He turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.  LAURIE They're just mowing 'em down. (pause) This is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.  CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG's stricken face as we  CUT TO:  162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE> We're back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE OWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame, like the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws closer, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out NIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.  There's a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless motions stylized and surreal.  They're beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as the Owlship's powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy equivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --  -- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE TRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the action QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in full-color and real-time --  163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP -- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the Watchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St. Seaport!  164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.  DREIBERG Okay Laurie, let's see if we've still got what it takes.  On the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.  165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT A RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.  CTU RADAR MAN Sir, we've got an odd blip off starboard . . .  The ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --  166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT -- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured ship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets sputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against the water.  167. ANGLE ON CROWD pointing at the skies in disbelief.  VOICE IN CROWD LOOK!  UP THERE!  VOICE IN CROWD II Oh my God, it's --   168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG He barks into a microphone:  DREIBERG Attention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --  169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK Ground level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the OWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:  OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER -- or we'll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!  CTU LOUDSPEAKER UNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.  OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER BABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.  The crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But a dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the strange sight overhead.  VOICE IN CROWD . . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!  EXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air, clumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging immobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West showdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate into position.  170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.  DREIBERG We're gonna have to shave this one close.  An instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle FULL-FORWARD.  171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP With a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS CONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond before -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES FORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD CHEERS.  172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT DREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the aft view from the ship.  LAURIE They're following us.  DREIBERG All right.  Mission accomplished.  He's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the ship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.  173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT The OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU SHIPS rip past on either side.  174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT ASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The OWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE blows a HOLE in its facade.  175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP firing TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.  176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar readout:  LAURIE Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!  DREIBERG I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.  LAURIE (checking the monitor) They're practically on us . . .  DREIBERG That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.  He punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled ""TURBO.""  177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP The turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving the CTU craft in the dust.  178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT A line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly, and -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.  A moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The less-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and EXPLODES  The SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last moment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP ITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles for the airborne route.  179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER The OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the cars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.  There's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges UP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS against the roof of the tunnel.  180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The end of the tunnel is coming up fast.  DREIBERG Fog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.  181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT The OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an almost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its wake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives -- but, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward on a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the water.  182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT They're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of intense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.  LAURIE We lost him.  He flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she shakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.  LAURIE (cont.) Oh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.  FADE THROUGH TO:  183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT The usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving line.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall and falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of him.  TRUSTY Just left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.  The CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes through the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds, it's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named T-BONE.  CON IN LINE Otis went down.  T-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of SIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the biggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET: LITTLE BIGGER.  T-BONE Just heard, boss.  Otis bought it.  LITTLE BIGGER Fuckin' Rorschach. (nodding to himself) This joint goes up.  Tonight.  184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT Drifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship emerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale blue moonlight.  185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT Through the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then disappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour of the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is singing ""You're My Thrill.""  Instruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the controls.  The ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the width of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it right.  It's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG. The pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the cabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.  LAURIE Better.  Much better.  DREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile instead.  LAURIE (cont.) I bet I know what made the difference this time.  DREIBERG What?  LAURIE (smirking) The costumes.  Am I right?  DREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite himself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.  LAURIE (cont.) Come on.  Admit it!  DREIBERG No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.  LAURIE Yes you are.  DREIBERG (drily) No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on. (pause; then, seriously) Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.  LAURIE That's because --  DREIBERG It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end. (a weird smile) I feel like I could save it.  He grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to the instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship hard right.  LAURIE You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?  DREIBERG Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . . (turning to face her) I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.  LAURIE . . . What??  DREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches for the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.  186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT AFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through the clouds above the city.  CUT TO:  187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON -- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL as we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild: disabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons, throwing food.  188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are riveted to a monitor over the controls:  DREIBERG I think we're just a trifle late.  LAURIE Jesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .  The MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below them.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire with the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.  DREIBERG I know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen times.  189. INT. CELL - NIGHT SIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs drawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.  190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT Smoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past sprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR MENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the psychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE, and T-BONE.  Wheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop outside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.  LITTLE BIGGER Find an outlet for this thing (shouting) Rorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!  RAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying a big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's door, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.  CARLOS See this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . . and pickle 'em!! (chortling) Aww!  I think he just wet his pants!  HILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place at the panel in the door:  T-BONE Lemme see.  Lemme see!  LITTLE BIGGER Relax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve. (to T-BONE) What's he doin' now?  No response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed tightly to the panel.  LITTLE BIGGER (cont.) You deaf?  I said, what's he --  He gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over backwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON quivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye socket.  RAFE BOSS!  JESUS!  LITTLE BIGGER Son of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE A GRAPE. (to RAFE) Light the torch.  RAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of RORSCHACH's cage.  191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT RORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the inside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.  CUT TO:  192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic EARMUFFS.  DREIBERG Okay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof running . . .  He throws a switch on the control panel.  193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT WINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH splits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop their weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as the Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .  194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT The LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S FACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the wall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his TOILET.  Grunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its mounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is FLOODED.  195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER RAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.  RAFE Okay, boss, that oughta do it.  They give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER come gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.  LITTLE BIGGER WHAT THE --  RAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but there's no trace of RORSCHACH.  CARLOS Rorschach.  Company's calling . . .  RAFE Where is the fuckin' runt?  CARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his fist.  196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT In answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door. He SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of the LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .  . . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS, monkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide and an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.  CARLOS YOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --  From the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor BETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --  -- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --  -- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do a herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --  -- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock DIM and DIE.  LITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down off his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies of the dead.  RORSCHACH Your move . . . runt.  The midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor as fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.  197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER DREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to get their bearings.  LAURIE Where are we?  What happened to the lights?  DREIBERG Generators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary . . .  Their heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND CORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a SCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.  DREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a familiar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.  DREIBERG . . . Rorschach??  RORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second and a half -- then keeps on walking.  198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER The terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He throws a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him. Desperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.  RORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him, LAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross corridor.  LAURIE Rorschach!  Is that you??  He turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and dispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand at the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.  LAURIE What's he doing?  DREIBERG I think he's going to the john.  LAURIE My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --  Before she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a paper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a ""howdy.""  DREIBERG . . . That was quick.  RORSCHACH Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd. (beat) Let's get out of here.  CUT TO:  199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT A well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky Mountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.  Air Force One is coming in for a landing.  200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER Lots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling about.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.  SECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and what looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal ramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an imposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating a long stay.  PRESIDENT NIXON Hello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?  SECRETARY LIDDY She's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right away.  LIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless corridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.  SECRETARY LIDDY (cont.) Weatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour window.  PRESIDENT NIXON Fourteen hours, huh?  SECRETARY LIDDY Fourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.  CUT TO:  201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT LAURIE's following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen . . .  NEWSCASTER -- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place the one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --  . . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control console, occupied by other matters.  DREIBERG I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.  RORSCHACH Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.  DREIBERG What new information?  RORSCHACH Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . (scratching his chin)  Strange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.  There's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG, highly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.  DREIBERG I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.  LAURIE Will you two lovebirds keep it down?  Still grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at the monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the screen:  NEWSCASTER . . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was unavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the Antarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.  RORSCHACH ""Ozone layer""?  DREIBERG (rolling his eyes) Christ.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??  CUT TO:  202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT The last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of pristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous strip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered around what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is one.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.  203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT The entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian style as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad figure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered LYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him. One of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a silver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back of the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.  LACKEY Welcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.  VEIDT Feed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.  They hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him to:  204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT The room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated REMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair, RED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.  VEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal a towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid, picking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more informational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp, a hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in and his eyes begin to rove.  205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL PANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials, sitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled ""LONDON."" VEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE comes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense logo . . .  BBC NEWSCASTER -- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as possible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter can be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --  FLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to the right, to the monitor labelled ""WASHINGTON D.C.""  Sound up:  NEWSCASTER -- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have already been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen insist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing negotiations --  FLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the bottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic retreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new angle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are clear.  FLICK --  -- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're watching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from twenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas canteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to propose.  206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT eyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.  CUT TO:  207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT LOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds. On its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.  208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of the city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS, gradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off, POLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.  DREIBERG They've got my building surrounded. (looking up at her) They must've been following you all along.  She stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the accelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.  DREIBERG (cont.) So much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.  LAURIE Welcome back, Night Owl.  DREIBERG What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?  RORSCHACH CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.  DREIBERG What do you mean, frame-up?  RORSCHACH Obvious pattern -- all ties in --  DREIBERG Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us? (spreading his hands) What about all those poor shits with cancer?  TIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting distress.  RORSCHACH How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .  DREIBERG Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --  LAURIE (interrupting him) It's not.  RORSCHACH Not what?  LAURIE Not ""propaganda."" (pause; then, blurting it out --) Christ, I'm one of them!  I've got it.  DREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face bone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her grim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can think of anything to say.  Then RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the ""case,"" breaks the silence.  RORSCHACH Hnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.  209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT RORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he pries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily at a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers above.  210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.  LAURIE I should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between us to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --  DREIBERG It doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.  He tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up with tears.  LAURIE I love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get myself together, okay?  211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP. RORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of satisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees DREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.  Above their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.  212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT LAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona resolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.  LAURIE Jon.  What are you doing here?  DR. MANHATTAN I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.  LAURIE Collect me?  DR. MANHATTAN In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .  LAURIE Jon, no -- I can't --  DR. MANHATTAN It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.  DREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside the cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR. MANHATTAN's hand.  DREIBERG LAURIE!  DON'T --  Hands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.  Stunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can do.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.  RORSCHACH Where's Laurie?  DREIBERG I don't think she's coming with us.  DISSOLVE TO:  213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT A BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian surface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later LAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps, then GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red sands.  DR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a problem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at the air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back and extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by a HALO OF OXYGEN.  DR. MANHATTAN The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.  LAURIE Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --  Ignoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she stops in her tracks.  Before her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a PALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren sands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS, surrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and pendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering crystalline castle.  DR. MANHATTAN I live here now.  He strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after him.  CUT TO:  214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT TIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the glow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.  RORSCHACH Heading south.  What's the plan?  DREIBERG We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.  RORSCHACH Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --  DREIBERG (exploding) Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.  RORSCHACH Coward.  Giving up.  DREIBERG SHUT UP, Rorschach.  RORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.  RORSCHACH Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that. (pause) Sorry about Laurie.  DREIBERG (choked voice) Okay, let's just . . . thank you.  For a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well enough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.  RORSCHACH Veidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.  CUT TO:  215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT LAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals around the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the enormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING -- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.  LAURIE This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?  DR. MANHATTAN Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.  LAURIE You -- you know about me and Dan?  He gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.  DR. MANHATTAN Time is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll finally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.  LAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.  LAURIE Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about? (flustered) Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.  DR. MANHATTAN (startled) Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?  LAURIE Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.  DR. MANHATTAN That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses. (nodding) We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.  She GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle of the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles below them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent WIND whips across their faces.  DR. MANHATTAN I'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way out toward the edge of the universe. (staring out at the landscape) Utterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?  She moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and fissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and frightened.  LAURIE Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?  DR. MANHATTAN Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.  LAURIE Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.  DR. MANHATTAN I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.  LAURIE But you knew that I'd -- die.  DR. MANHATTAN Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . . (pause) You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.  LAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.  LAURIE Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.  DR. MANHATTAN (nodding) Always.  Ever since the day I died.  He walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the forbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in her hands.  DR. MANHATTAN (cont.) Do you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me these last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be destroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless agent of its destruction?  LAURIE (sobbing) Then why don't you . . . do something about it!  DR. MANHATTAN Because --  LAURIE Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot. (angrily) Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?  DR. MANHATTAN I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.  That about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the shoulders:  LAURIE I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.  DR. MANHATTAN Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone. (reaching for her hand) You're the last human being I'll ever see.  CUT TO:  216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT The OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south Atlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and begins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .  217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro. Finally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad tumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:  RORSCHACH What happened?  DREIBERG The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.  RORSCHACH What caused it?  DREIBERG Don't know.  Nothing I can think of -- (apprehensively) -- outside of a nuclear blast.  DISSOLVE TO:  218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT VEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible through a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.  219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT VEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled ³MOSCOW² and ³WASHINGTON, D.C.² -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.  A second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.  220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT The OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.  221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT Through the cockpit, KARNAK¹s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it¹s lost in the snows again.  DREIBERG I¹m taking her down. (frantically throwing switches) Radar¹s blown.  I¹ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --  The SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.  222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.  A HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They¹re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.  223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT VEIDT¹s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.  As he watches, the screens for ³LONDON² and ³PARIS² go WHITE.  224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER DREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN¹S VOICE announces:  VOICE Welcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.  DREIBERG Adrian!  It¹s Dreiberg.  For God¹s sake open the doors.  Nothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.  DREIBERG (cont.) Adrian!  We¹re freezing to death out here!  He slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.  RORSCHACH . . . He¹s not coming, Daniel.  225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT On the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.  The wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, ³PRAGUE² goes white.  226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT DREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.  DREIBERG Can¹t move . . . we¹re done for.  RORSCHACH Come on.  Found an exhaust vent.  RORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Veidt.  It¹s been Veidt all along.  He¹ll pay for this.  227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT VEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.  TWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.  VEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX growls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's neck: quiet, girl.  RORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN FLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening scene.  Suddenly . . .  RORSCHACH VEIDT!  VEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall; it catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG backs against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward him, TEETH BARED.  VEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a futuristic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along -- part of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.  DREIBERG Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?  RORSCHACH He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.  DREIBERG Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --  VEIDT Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .  DREIBERG The missing scientists.  VEIDT Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.  RORSCHACH Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .  VEIDT Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.  228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Gun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak. RORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping at his heels.  VEIDT Blake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers -- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia. (tapping his chest) It was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill him.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my ""assassination"" -- that was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting rid of Dr. Manhattan.  DREIBERG What??  VEIDT I couldn't let him interfere with my project.  RORSCHACH Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.  VEIDT No.  I just hastened the inevitable. (smiling) He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.  DREIBERG Laurie?  You're responsible for --  VEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls out a smoke and strikes it against the box.  VEIDT (cont.) One thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate than it is to cure.  DREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the stun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and LEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.  VEIDT Let's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you without a moment's thought.  They've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200 SCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them inside.  RORSCHACH Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.  VEIDT Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.  229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER VEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand corner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila Flats, reassembling a WATCH.  DREIBERG What is this?  It looks like Jon.  VEIDT It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.  DREIBERG Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?  VEIDT It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.  CUT TO:  230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him, LAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's hit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On Mars.  DR. MANHATTAN I almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a mystery I'd like to penetrate.  LAURIE Jon, I do not want to hear it.  DR. MANHATTAN I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .  LAURIE (shaking her head) Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.  DR. MANHATTAN You're the only human being I care for.  LAURIE Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit. (pause) I want you to cure me.  DR. MANHATTAN I won't do that.  LAURIE You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.  DR. MANHATTAN I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.  LAURIE Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.  Eyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her chest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.  Her fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR. MANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the hardest decision of his life.  And then . . .  A BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN INTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian landscape altogether.  With a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see the figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great white VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the Martian desert gradually materialize around them.  The two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like statues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.  LAURIE What -- am I --  DR. MANHATTAN Cured, yes.  Utterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a handrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart attack.  LAURIE Jon, what is it?  What's the matter?  When he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with DREAD.  DR. MANHATTAN Something. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on me.  -- I can't remember the future.  Slowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around him.  LAURIE Jon.  Let's go back to Earth.  CUT TO:  231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT VEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F. room at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring machinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.  Inside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON OSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into its brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching him from twenty-four years in the future.  VEIDT Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes. (pause) Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.  DREIBERG What is it?  How does it work?  VEIDT It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time. (smiling) There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --  DREIBERG Adrian -- you've lost it.  VEIDT (pointing at the tachyon bubble) I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. (pause)  In some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it survives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.  He draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.  VEIDT (cont.) The creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war. (wild-eyed) Do you understand now?  Do you see what I¹m going to do?  I¹m going to change the past!  232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.  LAURIE We¹re too late.  DR. MANHATTAN It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .  LAURIE Jon -- what??  DR. MANHATTAN The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.  233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT Inside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY¹s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.  VEIDT At first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.  He steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.  VEIDT It ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds. (turning to face them) In a minute I¹ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I¹ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman¹s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.  DREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.  RORSCHACH . . . And they call me a fucking nut.  DREIBERG Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.  VEIDT Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?  DREIBERG And what if you¹re wrong?  VEIDT I¹m not.  DREIBERG What if you¹re wrong??  VEIDT Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ! (shouting) I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!  234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.  DR. MANHATTAN That¹s it.  That¹s the source of the time disturbance.  LAURIE Jon, where are we?  DR. MANHATTAN Veidt¹s complex.  235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT  Twenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler¹s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:  VEIDT Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.  DREIBERG You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?  VEIDT We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.  He kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum. Then he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.  236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS In the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears a SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .  237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT A LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon bubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up --  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the trigger . . .  . . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM. VEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .  . . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with LAURIE at his side.  DR. MANHATTAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?  VEIDT Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.  DR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees himself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of the I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's surprised.  In the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to sidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN THE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.  VEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He shoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and points his STUN GUN directly at her --  -- and a millisecond later, he¹s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.  VEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN¹s outstretched finger --  VEIDT NO!!!!  -- and in the wink of an eye, he¹s VAPORIZED.  All that¹s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.  DREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.  LAURIE What was he doing?  DREIBERG Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --  DR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.  DR. MANHATTAN He was right.  RORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.  DR. MANHATTAN He did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It¹s so elegant.  It¹s so obvious.  DR. MANHATTAN¹s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.  LAURIE Jon --  DR. MANHATTAN Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.  LAURIE Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?  DR. MANHATTAN I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!  He lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz around his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the room dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the world into his own massive frame.  DR. MANHATTAN My work here is finished . . .  The others cower.  They sense that something large is about to happen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the test chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the tiny hole in time.  He does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS into a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND STEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.  238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT JON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter bewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling gloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.  DR. MANHATTAN Don't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.  A second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps forward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.  For a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame surrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR. MANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the chamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across the shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he spreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding FLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging with nothingness . . .  . . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue light dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's alive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.  239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER The timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of his awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation panel.  SCIENTIST What in the name of God . . .  The SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY, sobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As she clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he looks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .  JON Your watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --  SCIENTIST II LOOK!!  The SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber . . . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular RUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are three odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH.  240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the astounded SCIENTISTS.  LAURIE What happened -- ?  DREIBERG He saved himself.  He changed the past.  LAURIE Where did he go?  Before DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to THROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For a moment everything's back to normal --  -- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to DISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.  A sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around them, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge into . . .  241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT DREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an otherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time could be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this would be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate; their tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they know it, they find themselves deposited --  242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT -- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them materialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them, slamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the same, knocking over a fire hydrant.  LAURIE Dan, is this -- is this New York??  DREIBERG Those cars.  What year is this??  LAURIE Everything's changed --  It's a disorienting world they've landed in.  In fact, it's our world, our New York, and everything -- the cars, the clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of whack . . .  RORSCHACH Hnrrrrr -- we never happened.  BYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the obvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of course, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden presence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers: Nuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?  RORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too close, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to several dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection altogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a shrill WHISTLE.  DREIBERG Oh my God, they still ride around on horses!  243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT The same newsstand we've seen all along -- but luckily, here in our world, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: ""RUSSIAN SUMMIT TALKS COLLAPSE.""  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR is gapin at the ruckus on the street.  NEWS VENDOR Jesus Christ, it must be Halloween.  His sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to the befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.  KID Shit, man!  It's Rorschach!  And Night Owl!  NEWS VENDOR What are you talkin' about?  KID Superheroes!  Check it out!  He thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR's hand and races off to join the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares down at the costumed characters in the comic book -- ""WATCHMEN"" -- then throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the street.  KID All right!  They must be on a case.  244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT HORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed with curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived to clear the streets and restore order.  COP I Break it up!  Stand back!  COP II Come on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --  DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle. They don't know what to expect and they're poised for a brawl.  The taunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant to advance.  LAURIE Dan -- what do we do now?  DREIBERG (panicked) Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --  LAURIE We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?  RORSCHACH They'd better.  And on RORSCHACH's final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and  FADE OUT.  THE END",0.475,0.501,11,-5.125,1,0.0309,0.715,0.0,0.0666,0.371,159.972

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Aw, who would ever want to be king?

I hold on so nervously to me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should
This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

[Verse 2]
I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me

[Verse 1]
No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire
Sooner or later, I get what I'm askin' for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
The truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free, to

[Pre-Chorus]
Admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on
And leave you behind

[Chorus]
I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction

You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you (I'll always have you)

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror
It didn't deliver

Sorry, but I gotta be strong and leave you behind

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

Tell 'em put the money in my hand right now (Yes)
Tell the promoter we need more seats
We just sold out all the floor seats

[Chorus 1: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy

[Verse 1: Estelle]
He said, ""Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya""
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type
Like the way he's speakin', his confidence is peakin'
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And, no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bredrin
I'm likin' this American boy, American boy

Can we get away this weekend? Take me to Broadway
Let's go shopping, maybe then we'll go to a café
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Sneakers lookin' fresh to death, I'm lovin' those Shell Toes
Walkin' that walk, talk that slick talk
I'm likin' this American boy, American boy

Who killin' them in the UK?
Everybody gonna say, ""You, K""
Reluctantly, 'cause most of this press don't fuck with me

Don't act a fool now, now.""
I always act a fool oww, oww
Ain't nothing new now, now
He crazy, I know what you thinkin'
Ribena, I know what you're drinkin'
Rap singer, chain blinger
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinkin'
What's your persona about this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow 'cause all my clothes designer? Uh
Dressed smart like a London bloke (Yeah)
Before he speak his suit bespoke (Woop)
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this pea coat, tell me he's broke (Woo)
And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash
'Cause a lotta wags wanna hear it
And I'm feelin' like Mike at his baddest
Like The Pips at their gladdest
And I know they love it
So to hell with all that rubbish

Would you be mine?

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said
[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Da-da-da-da

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill
[Verse 2]
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy!""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me

Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist

2006,8,Ridin',Chamillionaire Featuring Krayzie Bone,-0.9948,0.11199999999999999,0.128,0.76,"Hi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Chamillionaire. Now, back in the mid 2000's, there was a short time when Texas was all the rage in Hip-Hop. For a brief 2 or 3 years, you couldn't escape Houston rappers such as Mike Jones, Paul Wall, Lil Flip, and even old school cats like UGK started coming back on the scene. But among these emcees, few of them had as big a hit as Chamillionaire with Ridin', a forceful tune with a vibrating bass line, thumping drums, driving synths, and an unforgettable hook that brought him a number one hit on the billboard charts. Although, for a song that was such a club banger, it was actually an anthem against racial prejudice embedded in the American Police force, the likes of which we hadn't seen achieve such popularity since… well, N.W.A. For those who don't know, the phrase ""ridin' dirty"" refers to having something illegal in your car while driving, usually drugs. And in the context of the chorus...

They see me rollin, They hatin
Patrolling they tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty

He's referring to racist cops who use their badge as an excuse to hassle people of color because they assume if they're rollin' in a nice ride, it MUST be because they're dealing drugs, and so these racist cops can't wait to reaffirm their biased views and pull over a black man with the intent of, ""put them in their place,"" as it were, that place being jail. And this is a very real problem. Seeing that black people are only about 13 percent of the American population, there is a disproportionate amount of Black people who are arrested for having marijuana in comparison to white people being arrested for having it, and if you've ever been to a predominantly white college, you know that that's not simply because white kids ""don't have as much""… So, in a slick way, this song is calling out that racial disparity, and by the sing-song nature of the chorus, it seems to take pleasure in subverting the cops' expectations

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tinted so it ain't easy to be seen

Okay, so, we start off with Chamillionaire telling us of his desire to be seen, quickly followed by him telling us that because his car's tinted, you can't really see him… okay… not the strongest way to start a song like this, but whatever…

Ride with a new chick, she like hold up

AUGH!!! *calms down* Sorry, after that ""We Dem Boyz"" review, I'd just rather not hear that phrase in a rap song for a while

Next to the playstation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola, Send a jacker into a coma

Alright, here he's saying that if you try to steal his stuff, he'll… wait, wasn't this song about the police?

Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone

Wait, is he telling all of this to the girl he's in the car with? Well, I guess telling her that he can protect himself from any carjackers probably would make her feel safe, but… maybe when talking to a lady in your car, you shouldn't immediately follow up your line about owning a gun with a line about being mentally unstable…
Just tryin to bone ain't tryin to have no babies

That's… nice… so, how about those cops?

Laws on patrol and you know they hate me

Okay, so finally we get to the point: police harassing him purely based on the fact that he has a nice car

Twin steady twistin like ""hit this though""

Wait, so your friend is twisting up something that he wants you to take a hit of? Oh… oh…

Police pull up from behind and is in his throat

And when the police pulled up, he swallowed this thing that he wanted you to take a hit of?

Windows down gotta stop pollution

And then, you immediately rolled down the windows, to get rid of the smell this certain thing carried with it?

CDs change, niggas like ""who is that producing?""

Hey, don't change the subject, you are ridin' dirty! Well, I guess he never explicitly said that he WASN'T ridin' dirty, he just said they're trying to catch him ridin' dirty, but to his credit, he never said he was smoking anything while driving either: he said that his friend was about to light something up, and offered it to him, but he never took it. However, of course, if the cops smelled any weed on them at all, it'd be game over for the both of them, a fate that, statistically would be 3 times less likely to happen if they were white. Now, this is a bit of a nuanced criticism I'm going with here, because I'm not saying that if a black dude should be caught doing something illegal, he shouldn't go to jail, far from it; however, I'm saying that a young black male driving a nice car should be held under the same scrutiny by police officers as if he were, say, a late 20's, early 30's upper class white guy in a nice car. By the way, thank you, music video, for that illustration. But yeah, this guy's a young, rich rapper who got where he was by being a talented artist, and if he wants to enjoy the fruits of his success, he shouldn't be profiled because of it!

Got warrants in every city except Houston
Yeah, so what he has a warrant for his arrest in*change tone* every city in American except Houston? Jeez, man! And… what are you doing in Houston that's illegal anywhere else? Well, regardless, look, I understand about racial profiling and all that, but if you've got warrant's in almost every city in America, there's no way it's racial profiling at that point. I'm pretty sure you're just kind of a criminal. Either that, or he needs to stop letting his stoner friends ride passenger. Regardless, that was not a good way to end that verse. I mean, for the most part Cham doesn't directly come off as the stereotype that the police are making him out to be, so I tried to give the guy the benefit of a doubt, but a line like that throws all of it out the window, especially at the tail end there. I don't know, maybe a guest verse from Krayzie Bone could give us a more empathetic character, a guy who's getting hassled by cops, even though he's done nothing wrong

I been drinkin and smokin holy shit cause I really can't focus

Okay… never mind that idea…

I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this

Okay, so… maybe he's drinking and smoking… at the same time… but hey, he might not be hurting anybody!

I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this
Big ol Excursion swerving all up in the curb and...

Oh, on the curb? So, he's driving a Huge car down a… sidewalk…. that's… bad...

Doin a hundred while I puff on the blunt

Oh, driving at 100 miles per hour onto a sidewalk… that is… not better… Yeah, there's no justification for this! You can argue about making weed legal all day, but I think you'll have far fewer supporters for driving 100 miles per hour while drunk and high. Sorry, I'm gonna have to side with the police when it comes to actions that can directly lead to...

*plays car crash at the end of the song*

...well, that. Weird that we're supposed to be rooting for Krayzie Bone in this song as the cool badass when the tail end of the song shows you the exact reason why it's illegal to be impaired behind the wheel of a car!

DAMN! I done spilled my drink…

…precisely!
Yo I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the 6 pounds and
I got heat Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me

Oh, so you're committing murder now? The hell? We don't even know why he's doing it either! There's no justification for this happening, just out of nowhere, he decides, in his intoxicated stupor, that he's going to kill someone

With no regards for the law we dodge em like fuck em all

Okay, how is this song supposed to work again? Because the way the chorus and this verse is coming together, it sounds like they're saying ""Hey! Isn't it stupid how racist cops assume black people to be criminals?"" *guncock*""Let's justify these assumptions!"" Well, maybe something else is going on! Maybe, the idea is that Krayzie Bone is the one who's REALLY the criminal, but since the cops are so busy following Chamillionaire because he has a nice ride, they're letting the REAL criminal get away! Yeah, so Krayzie Bone is committing crimes, while Chamillionaire has nothing to do with--

We bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

Oh, so they ARE hanging out together. Well, there goes THAT theory

And they upset for sure cause they think they know
That they catchin me with plenty of the drank and dro

Well, if you're hanging out with Krayzie Bone, they will! Sorry, but Krayzie kinda ruined your vibe here. Whereas MAYBE you could excuse the last lyric in the first verse and take at face value the fact that Chamillionaire hadn't explicitly stated that he had done anything illegal, verifying the chorus as a justified chant against corruption in the American legal system, Krayzie Bone negates all of that, and makes it not about the common man mad at corruption in the police department, but about a reckless thug mad at police officers for doing their jobs, and sure, you can have a song about criminal lifestyles and all that, but the smugness and assuredness of that chorus led me to believe you guys were supposed to be the ones in the right in this scenario, being done wrong by the man, but when you're committing criminal acts, obviously out of love for being a criminal, since we have absolutely no reasonings behind your activities beyond ""wow, isn't shooting people and driving over the speed limit cool!?"" yeah, I'm sorry, but that doesn't garner as much empathy

So they get behind me tryin to check my tags, look at my rearview and they smilin
Thinkin they'll catch me on the wrong, they keep tryin
Steady denyin that it's racial profiling

You know, I'd be right there with ya on this if you hadn't mentioned the little part about having warrants in almost every city for your arrest! Call me cynical, but I highly doubt those warrants came from you running into EVERY racist cop in America. Okay, maybe I should let that line go, it was in the first verse, and from the way it was written, it might not have even been originally intended for this song. This is the third verse, and everything's completely different now… I guess…

Glove compartment gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast

You know, you could see this as a bad character move on his part, but honestly, hey, he just knows the game: in the case of crooked police, it's not about justice and equality on their end, so Cham might as well play along. And actually, when you think about stuff like parking tickets, speeding tickets, and getting out of jail on bail, the only lesson to really take away from all that is, ""give us enough money, and we'll leave you alone"". So, yeah, it's messed up, but Cham is circumventing wasting time with the system by giving the man what he wants

And been a baller that I am I talk to them, giving a damn bout not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin dirty bet you'll be leavin with an even madder mood

Yeah, take THAT, One time! Your racial prejudice blew up right in your face, giving me a legitimate reason to not take you seriously as an officer. You're an embarrassment to the force, acting on such bigoted, baseless principles! Just… don't look over there at Krayzie Bone, just, just look at me

Well, overall, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. A LOT of this song is carried on a stellar hook and fun, bouncy production, and both emcees are quite lyrical with their delivery, by the end of the song encapsulating a lot of the distrust that black people in general have against the police. However, the constant deviations from the topic, most of which only serve to brag about getting chicks, being intoxicated and violent, ultimately fulfill the same role that racist cops look for when persecuting black people, and despite it still being drenched with tight wordplay, that fact alone throws out a lot of that goodwill. It's still a better than average song, and attempted to do more than typical mainstream rap song was doing at the time, but unfortunately, it didn't focus on delivering the topic strong enough to rate it higher

Well, I'm the Rap Critic. You don't have to like my opinion, but before you ask, of COURSE I loved the Weird Al parody. you'd have to be some kind of moron to not love Weird Al, man…","Hi.

Well, I guess telling her that he can protect himself from any carjackers probably would make her feel safe, but… maybe when talking to a lady in your car, you shouldn't immediately follow up your line about owning a gun with a line about being mentally unstable… Just tryin to bone ain't tryin to have no babies  That's… nice… so, how about those cops?  Laws on patrol and you know they hate me  Okay, so finally we get to the point: police harassing him purely based on the fact that he has a nice car  Twin steady twistin like ""hit this though""  Wait, so your friend is twisting up something that he wants you to take a hit of? Oh… oh…  Police pull up from behind and is in his throat  And when the police pulled up, he swallowed this thing that he wanted you to take a hit of?  Windows down gotta stop pollution  And then, you immediately rolled down the windows, to get rid of the smell this certain thing carried with it?  CDs change, niggas like ""who is that producing?""  Hey, don't change the subject, you are ridin' dirty! Well, I guess he never explicitly said that he WASN'T ridin' dirty, he just said they're trying to catch him ridin' dirty, but to his credit, he never said he was smoking anything while driving either: he said that his friend was about to light something up, and offered it to him, but he never took it. However, of course, if the cops smelled any weed on them at all, it'd be game over for the both of them, a fate that, statistically would be 3 times less likely to happen if they were white. Now, this is a bit of a nuanced criticism I'm going with here, because I'm not saying that if a black dude should be caught doing something illegal, he shouldn't go to jail, far from it; however, I'm saying that a young black male driving a nice car should be held under the same scrutiny by police officers as if he were, say, a late 20's, early 30's upper class white guy in a nice car. By the way, thank you, music video, for that illustration. But yeah, this guy's a young, rich rapper who got where he was by being a talented artist, and if he wants to enjoy the fruits of his success, he shouldn't be profiled because of it!  Got warrants in every city except Houston Yeah, so what he has a warrant for his arrest in*change tone* every city in American except Houston? Jeez, man! And… what are you doing in Houston that's illegal anywhere else? Well, regardless, look, I understand about racial profiling and all that, but if you've got warrant's in almost every city in America, there's no way it's racial profiling at that point. I'm pretty sure you're just kind of a criminal. Either that, or he needs to stop letting his stoner friends ride passenger. Regardless, that was not a good way to end that verse. I mean, for the most part Cham doesn't directly come off as the stereotype that the police are making him out to be, so I tried to give the guy the benefit of a doubt, but a line like that throws all of it out the window, especially at the tail end there. I don't know, maybe a guest verse from Krayzie Bone could give us a more empathetic character, a guy who's getting hassled by cops, even though he's done nothing wrong  I been drinkin and smokin holy shit cause I really can't focus  Okay… never mind that idea…  I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this  Okay, so… maybe he's drinking and smoking… at the same time… but hey, he might not be hurting anybody!  I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this Big ol Excursion swerving all up in the curb and...  Oh, on the curb? So, he's driving a Huge car down a… sidewalk…. that's… bad...  Doin a hundred while I puff on the blunt  Oh, driving at 100 miles per hour onto a sidewalk… that is… not better… Yeah, there's no justification for this! You can argue about making weed legal all day, but I think you'll have far fewer supporters for driving 100 miles per hour while drunk and high. Sorry, I'm gonna have to side with the police when it comes to actions that can directly lead to...  *plays car crash at the end of the song*  ...well, that. Weird that we're supposed to be rooting for Krayzie Bone in this song as the cool badass when the tail end of the song shows you the exact reason why it's illegal to be impaired behind the wheel of a car!  DAMN! I done spilled my drink…  …precisely! Yo I gotta hit the back streets Wanted by the 6 pounds and I got heat Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep Pop Pop hope cops don't see me  Oh, so you're committing murder now? The hell? We don't even know why he's doing it either! There's no justification for this happening, just out of nowhere, he decides, in his intoxicated stupor, that he's going to kill someone  With no regards for the law we dodge em like fuck em all  Okay, how is this song supposed to work again? Because the way the chorus and this verse is coming together, it sounds like they're saying ""Hey! Isn't it stupid how racist cops assume black people to be criminals?"" *guncock*""Let's justify these assumptions!"" Well, maybe something else is going on! Maybe, the idea is that Krayzie Bone is the one who's REALLY the criminal, but since the cops are so busy following Chamillionaire because he has a nice ride, they're letting the REAL criminal get away! Yeah, so Krayzie Bone is committing crimes, while Chamillionaire has nothing to do with--  We bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire  Oh, so they ARE hanging out together. Well, there goes THAT theory  And they upset for sure cause they think they know That they catchin me with plenty of the drank and dro  Well, if you're hanging out with Krayzie Bone, they will! Sorry, but Krayzie kinda ruined your vibe here. Whereas MAYBE you could excuse the last lyric in the first verse and take at face value the fact that Chamillionaire hadn't explicitly stated that he had done anything illegal, verifying the chorus as a justified chant against corruption in the American legal system, Krayzie Bone negates all of that, and makes it not about the common man mad at corruption in the police department, but about a reckless thug mad at police officers for doing their jobs, and sure, you can have a song about criminal lifestyles and all that, but the smugness and assuredness of that chorus led me to believe you guys were supposed to be the ones in the right in this scenario, being done wrong by the man, but when you're committing criminal acts, obviously out of love for being a criminal, since we have absolutely no reasonings behind your activities beyond ""wow, isn't shooting people and driving over the speed limit cool!?"" yeah, I'm sorry, but that doesn't garner as much empathy  So they get behind me tryin to check my tags, look at my rearview and they smilin Thinkin they'll catch me on the wrong, they keep tryin Steady denyin that it's racial profiling  You know, I'd be right there with ya on this if you hadn't mentioned the little part about having warrants in almost every city for your arrest! Call me cynical, but I highly doubt those warrants came from you running into EVERY racist cop in America. Okay, maybe I should let that line go, it was in the first verse, and from the way it was written, it might not have even been originally intended for this song. This is the third verse, and everything's completely different now… I guess…  Glove compartment gotta get my cash Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast  You know, you could see this as a bad character move on his part, but honestly, hey, he just knows the game: in the case of crooked police, it's not about justice and equality on their end, so Cham might as well play along. And actually, when you think about stuff like parking tickets, speeding tickets, and getting out of jail on bail, the only lesson to really take away from all that is, ""give us enough money, and we'll leave you alone"". So, yeah, it's messed up, but Cham is circumventing wasting time with the system by giving the man what he wants  And been a baller that I am I talk to them, giving a damn bout not feeling my attitude When they realize I ain't even ridin dirty bet you'll be leavin with an even madder mood  Yeah, take THAT, One time! Your racial prejudice blew up right in your face, giving me a legitimate reason to not take you seriously as an officer. You're an embarrassment to the force, acting on such bigoted, baseless principles! Just… don't look over there at Krayzie Bone, just, just look at me  Well, overall, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. A LOT of this song is carried on a stellar hook and fun, bouncy production, and both emcees are quite lyrical with their delivery, by the end of the song encapsulating a lot of the distrust that black people in general have against the police. However, the constant deviations from the topic, most of which only serve to brag about getting chicks, being intoxicated and violent, ultimately fulfill the same role that racist cops look for when persecuting black people, and despite it still being drenched with tight wordplay, that fact alone throws out a lot of that goodwill. It's still a better than average song, and attempted to do more than typical mainstream rap song was doing at the time, but unfortunately, it didn't focus on delivering the topic strong enough to rate it higher  Well, I'm the Rap Critic. You don't have to like my opinion, but before you ask, of COURSE I loved the Weird Al parody. you'd have to be some kind of moron to not love Weird Al, man…",0.787,0.799,8,-4.68,0,0.0993,0.18899999999999997,0.0,0.3,0.835,143.05200000000002

[Verse 1]
Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothin' overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase, said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom, they see that we did that
(Yes) It's so true that
(Yes) We been through it
(Yes) We got real shit
(Yes) See, baby

[Chorus]
We've been too strong for too long
And I can't be without you, baby
And I'll be waitin' up until you get home
'Cause I can't sleep without you, baby (Oh)
Anybody who's ever loved you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothin' can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby, yeah
[Verse 2]
I got a question for ya (See, I already know the answer)
But still I wanna ask you, will you lie? (No)
Make me cry? (No)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is on the up and up
(Yes) I'll be faithful
(Yes) I'm for real
(Yes) And with us you'll always know the deal

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top (Uh-huh)
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (Oh) in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh) in my wife beat'
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I...

Eyes stay low from the chiefing (Chiefing)

Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)

I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

I'm becoming the part that don't last

I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves

Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th

But for right now, what we gotta do for y'all (what we gonna do)
We gotta give y'all a hit (huh)

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Niggas in my face, damn near er' day
Ask a million questions like, Joc where ya' stay?
Tell 'em Collegepark, where they chop cars
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood, posted at the store
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough
If a girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me, I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what you do (OK)
[Hook: Yung Joc]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
Verse number two, do the damn thing
Cubes on my neck, pockets full of Ben Frank's
When I'm in the mall, hoes just pause
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work, make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boy magic, seven days a week
Number one record, long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I think they like me, better yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew, we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout thirty-five cars
Bitches in the back, black Beamer coupe's
Girls liking girls, time to recruit
If ya' got a problem, say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place
[Hook: Yung Joc]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Time to set it off, let these nigga know
Have ya ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya' see the buckets on my feet
Fans on my trail, but they don't think I know
I keep my hands clean casue I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in they eyes
Ask me how I know, its me, surprise
Put it in the air, rep where ya' stay
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats
I'mma make it rain nigga, I ain't scared to share it

[Hook: Yung Joc]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down

[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help

'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel

Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was  anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, what you gonna—?""
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house

There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

He walks, you say, ""sit down, it's just a talk""

You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right

You begin to wonder why you came

Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night

Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong

Chasing cars
Around our heads

To remind me
To find my own

With words, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out

Weighed down with words too

Versus ""No one should ever feel like...""

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years

Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)

You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got J.O. up on my right side pourin' some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't givin a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today
But don't forget about this feeling that I am making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile-high points you earn when we taking my jet
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet cause you can

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)
[Verse 2]
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
[Bridge]
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could, I'd relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 1]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

(You never saw me, yeah yeah)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

I never stray too far from the sidewalk

I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing, ""Where'd you go?""

Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I’m planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing, ""Where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it
[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Post-Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home

It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' ever seen before
I say, ""Yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her"" (Meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her
Oh, should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say

Let me know that I've done wrong
When I've known this all along
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one
That needs to know

Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret

Prison gates won't open up for me

Oh, I reach for you
Well, I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in

No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby boy

[Verse 1]
Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

And if she's got your head
All messed up now
That's the trickery
So why you act like you don't know
How this loving used to be?
